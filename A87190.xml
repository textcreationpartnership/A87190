         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And to the end that <hi>Ingenuity</hi> and <hi>Induſtry</hi> may want no incouragement, in the meane time accept of theſe <hi>Enlargements</hi> upon the ſame <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;</hi> wherein you will find divers other wayes, and no leſſe (if not more) profitable, then that which was left by Sir <hi>RICHARD WESTON</hi> (the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Brabant-Husbandry)</hi> as a <hi>Legacy</hi> to his <hi>Sonnes:</hi> Whoſe <hi>Introduction</hi> to that <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> I have here premiſed to this, to beſpeake thee in <hi>his words</hi> to <hi>his Sonnes,</hi> and to gain thy affections more fully to theſe wayes of advantaging both <hi>thy ſelfe</hi> and the <hi>Publique.</hi> And I could wiſh, that God would put it in the heart of thoſe <hi>Worthies</hi> that manage the <hi>Publique Truſt,</hi> that by their <hi>Influence</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> theſe and ſuch like <hi>Meanes</hi> of <hi>Induſtry,</hi> may not be left wholly to the uncertaine, diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and lazy undertakings of private men, ſo as not to have an eye over them, and over that which in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings doth ſo mainly appeare to be a <hi>Publique Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Therefore let us all joine to intreate and petition them, that in order to the <hi>Publique</hi> and <hi>General Welfare</hi> of this <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> theſe two things at leaſt may be thought upon and ſetled.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the known unto wardnes of the Major part
<pb facs="tcp:114859:3"/> of the People; who being wonderfully wedded to old cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, are not eaſily won to any new courſe, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much to their owne profit, that two or more fit Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of approved skill and integrity may be made <hi>Publique Stewards</hi> or <hi>Surveyors;</hi> one of the <hi>Husbandly,</hi> the other of the <hi>Woods</hi> of this <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> and impowered to overſee and take care of the preſervation of what is, and by all good improvement to procure and provide for what is wanting to the preſent age: and (except ſome ſuch Expedients be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) it is more then likely will be wanting to ſuceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That according to the uſual cuſtome in <hi>Flaunders,</hi> a Law may be made of letting &amp; hiring Leaſes upon Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; where the manner is, That the <hi>Farmer</hi> covenanteth on his part, to improve the land to ſuch or ſuch a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Rent, by an orderly and excellent management of <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry,</hi> as well as Building. The <hi>Landlord</hi> on the other ſide covenanteth on his part, at the expiration of the ſaid Leaſe, to give ſo many years purchaſe of the Improvement (according to the agreement) which is 3. or 4. years or ſome times more, or to give out of it ſuch a parcel or moity of Ground. As if land formerly going for 6. 8. an Acre, be upon Improvement worth 10. 8. or 13. 8. 4. d. an Acre. The <hi>Landlord</hi> is to give 4. or 5. 8. upon every Acre, more or leſſe, according to the agreement. If it pleaſe God to bleſſe theſe Motions, and that accordingly the <hi>National Husbandry</hi> of this <hi>Common-wealth</hi> be improved; we may hope through Gods bleſſing to ſee better dayes, and to be able to beare <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>Publique burdens</hi> with more eaſe to our ſelves, and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to <hi>Humane Society</hi> then hitherto we could attaine unto.

            <p>The whole Diſcourſe ſhewes you, how to <hi>Improve barren</hi> and <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Land,</hi> and how to raiſe more then ordinary profit thereof, by ſuch waies and Meanes as are not practiſed in <hi>England:</hi> but as commonly in ſome parts of <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flaunders,</hi> as the <hi>Husbandry</hi> of <hi>Wheate</hi> and <hi>Rie</hi> is here.

So that it appeares by degrees, that what courſe ſoever a man taketh in this world, at laſt he cometh to <hi>Husbandry,</hi> which is the moſt <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Occupation</hi> amongſt men, the moſt <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Holy,</hi> being commanded by the mouth of God to our <hi>Firſt Fathers.</hi> There is <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Diligence</hi> requiſite in <hi>Husbandry,</hi> as there is in all the <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of the World; and therefore as a <hi>Captain</hi> hath a <hi>Lieutenant</hi> to command his <hi>Souldiers</hi> in his abſence, or for his eaſe: So muſt you provide ſome able honest man, to whom you will commit the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch things, as you your ſelves cannot do without too much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: whereof you muſt often take an account, and conferre with him (as occaſion ſhall require) about your buſineſſe, that nothing may be left undone for want of Providence. To ſuch a man you muſt give good wages, with intent to advance your own gaine, and take the more eaſe by reaſon of his honeſty and knowledge.</p>
            <p>You will finde this <hi>Husbandry</hi> (after you have once had experience of it) to be very pleaſing to you, and ſo exceeding profitable, that it will make you diligent: For no man of any <hi>Art</hi> or <hi>Science</hi> (except an <hi>Alchymiſt)</hi> ever pretended ſo much gaine any other way, as you ſhall ſee demonſtrated in this enſuing <hi>Treatiſe.</hi> The <hi>Uſerer</hi> doubles but
<pb facs="tcp:114859:4"/> his Principall, with Intereſt upon Intereſt in ſeven yeares; but by this little <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> you ſhall learne how to do more then treble your Principal in one years compaſſe. And you ſhall ſee how an <hi>Induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> man in <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flaunders</hi> would bring 500. Acres of <hi>barren</hi> and <hi>heathy Land,</hi> that was not worth at the moſt above 5. l. a year, to be worth 7000. l. a year, in leſſe time then ſeven years. I know no reaſon, why the like may not be done in <hi>England:</hi> for we are under as good a Climate as they are; Our <hi>heathy Land</hi> that is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Sand</hi> nor <hi>Loame,</hi> is as good a ſoile as their <hi>barren ground</hi> is. We have not onely <hi>Dung</hi> to enrich our <hi>Land,</hi> but alſo <hi>Lime</hi> and <hi>Marle,</hi> of which they know not the uſe, where they ſewe their gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt Commodities mentioned in this enſuing <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> nor of any other <hi>Manure,</hi> but onely <hi>Dung.</hi> In fine, I am certain, there is none of their Commodities but grow in <hi>England,</hi> as they do in <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flaunders,</hi> but ours are not of the ſame kinde, as theirs, nor put to the ſame uſe. What cannot be vented at home, may as well be vented from hence into <hi>Holland,</hi> as the like Commodities are from <hi>Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> thither. I will ſay no more of this <hi>Subject</hi> in the <hi>Preface:</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it remaines to tell you, that you muſt not expect either <hi>Eloquence</hi> or <hi>Method</hi> in this enſuing <hi>Treatiſe;</hi> but a true <hi>Story</hi> plainly ſet forth in the <hi>Laſt Will</hi> and <hi>Teſtament</hi> of your <hi>Father,</hi> which he would have you execute: but before all things, to be ſure you lay the <hi>Foundation</hi> of your <hi>Husbandry</hi> upon the <hi>Bleſſings</hi> of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, continually imploring his divine aide and aſſiſtance in all your labours: for it is God that <hi>gives the increaſe:</hi> and beleeving this as the <hi>Quinteſſence</hi> and ſoul of <hi>Husbandry, Primum quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite Regnum Dei; et poſtea haec omnia adjicientur vobis.</hi> Theſe things being briefly premiſed, I will leave the rest to this ſhort enſuing <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> and commit you all with a <hi>Fathers</hi> Bleſſing to the <hi>Protection</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> of Almighty God.</p>

                  <hi>A Large letter concerning the Defects and Remedies of Engliſh Husbandry written to Mr.</hi> SAMUEL HARTLIB.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>According to your deſires, I have ſent you what I have obſerved in <hi>France,</hi> about the ſowing of a ſeed called commonly. <hi>Saint Foine,</hi> which in <hi>Engliſh</hi> is as much to ſay as <hi>Holy-Hay,</hi> by reaſon, as I ſuppoſe of the excellency of it. It's called by <hi>Parkinſon</hi> in his <hi>Herball,</hi> where you may ſee a perfect deſcription of it, <hi>Onobrychis Vulgaris,</hi> or <hi>Cockes head;</hi> becauſe of its flower, or <hi>Medick Fetchling:</hi> By ſome it is called <hi>Polygala;</hi> becauſe it cauſeth cattel to give abundance of milke. The plant moſt like unto it, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known; being frequently <hi>ſowne</hi> in gardens, is that which is called <hi>French Honey-ſuckle,</hi> and is a kind of it, though not the ſame. <hi>France</hi> although it be ſuppoſed, to want the feweſt things of any <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi> in <hi>Europe;</hi> yet it hath no ſmall want of <hi>Hay,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially about <hi>Paris;</hi> which hath neceſſitated them to ſowe their dry and barren lands with this ſeed. Their manner of ſowing it, is done moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus: When they intend to let their Corne-lands ly; becauſe they be out of heart, and not ſituate in a place convenient for manuring; then they ſowe that land with <hi>Oates</hi> and theſe ſeeds together about equall parts; the firſt year they only mowe off their <hi>Oates,</hi> leaving the <hi>Saint Foine</hi> to take root and ſtrength that year; Yet they may if they pleaſe, when the year is ſeaſonable, mowe it the ſame year it is ſowne; but it's not the beſt way to do ſo: the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114859:6"/> year following they mowe it, and ſo do ſeven years together; the ordinary burthen is obout a loade or a load and a halfe in good years, upon an <hi>Arpent,</hi> (which is an 100. ſquare Poles or Roddes, every Pole or Rod being 20. foot) which quantity of ground being nigh a 4th. part leſſe than an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Acre; within a league of <hi>Paris,</hi> is uſually Rented at 6. or 7. s. After the land hath reſted 7. years; then they uſually break it up, and ſowe it with Corne till it be out of heart, and then ſowe it with <hi>Saint Foine</hi> as formerly: for it doth not impoveriſh land, as <hi>Annuall Plants</hi> do; but after ſeven years, the roots of this plant being great and ſweet, as the roots of <hi>Licoriſh,</hi> do rot, being turned up by the Plough, and enrich the Land. I have ſeen it ſowne in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places here in <hi>England;</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Cobham-Park</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> about 4. miles from <hi>Graveſend;</hi> where it hath thriven extraordinary well upon dry Chalky bankes, where nothing elſe would grow: and indeed ſuch dry barren land is moſt proper for it as moiſt rich land for the great <hi>Trefoile</hi> or great <hi>Clover-Graſſe</hi> (although it will grow indifferently well on all lands) and when the other graſſes and plants are deſtroyed by the parching heat of the Sun; becauſe their roots are ſmall and ſhallow; this flouriſheth very much, having very great root and deepe in the ground, and therefore not eaſily to be <hi>exſiccated;</hi> As we have obſerved <hi>Ononis</hi> or <hi>Rest-Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> commonly to do, on dry lands; but if you ſowe this on wet land, the water ſoon corrupts the root of it. This plant without queſtion would much improve many of our barren lands, ſo that they might be mowen every year once, at leaſt 7. years
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114859:6"/> together, and yeeld excellent fodder for Cattel, if ſo be that it be rightly managed; otherwiſe it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to nothing; as I have ſeen by experience. I therefore councel thoſe who ſowe this, or the great <hi>Trefoile</hi> or <hi>Clover-Graſſe,</hi> or any other ſorts of graſſes; that they obſerve theſe Rules.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they do make their ground fine, and kill all ſorts of other graſſes and plants; otherwiſe they being native <hi>Engliſh</hi> will by no meanes give way to the <hi>French</hi> ones; eſpecially in this moiſt climate; and therefore they are to be blamed; who with one ploughing ſowe this or other ſeeds; for the graſſe preſently groweth up and choaketh them, and ſo by their negligence, and ill Husbandry, diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth themſelves and others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let them not be too ſparing of their ſeeds; for the more they ſowe, the cloſer and thicker they will grow, and preſently fully ſtock the ground, that nothing elſe can grow. And further, the ſeeds which come from beyond the Seas, are oftentimes old and much decayed, and therefore the more ſeed is required.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Not to expect above 7. years profit by it; for in that time it will decay, and the natural graſſe will prevail over it; for every plant hath his period; ſome in one year; ſome in 2. others in 3. as the common <hi>Thistle;</hi> and therefore after 7. years, let them either plough the land up, and ſowe it with that ſame ſeed again, or with other Graine as they do in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Let not <hi>ſheepe</hi> or other cattel bite them the firſt year, that they may be well rooted; For theſe graſſes are farre ſweeter then the ordinary graſſes; and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114859:7"/> cattel will eat them down, leaving the other; and conſequently diſcourage their growth.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The beſt way, if men will be at the charge, is to make their ground very fine, as they do when they are to ſowe <hi>Barly,</hi> and harrowe it even; and then to howe theſe ſeeds in alone without any other graine, as the Gardiners do <hi>Peaſe;</hi> yet not at ſo great a diſtance; but let them make the ranges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a foot's breadth one from another, and they ſhall ſee their graſſes flouriſh, as if they were green <hi>Peaſe;</hi> eſpecially if they draw the howe through them once or twice that ſummer to deſtroy all the weeds and graſſes: And if they do thus, the great <hi>Clover</hi> and other ſeeds may be mowen even twice the firſt year, as I have experimented in divers ſmall plots of ground.</p>
               <p>There is at <hi>Paris</hi> likewiſe another ſort of fodder, which they call <hi>La Lucerne,</hi> which is not inferior, but rather preferred before this <hi>Saint Foine,</hi> for dry and barren grounds; which hath been lately brought thither, and is managed as the former; and truely every day produceth ſome new things, not onely in other Countreys, but alſo in our own. And though I cannot but very much commend theſe plants unto my <hi>Countreymen,</hi> knowing that they may be beneficial to this <hi>Nation;</hi> yet I eſpecially recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend unto them a famous kind of graſſe growing in <hi>Wilſhire</hi> 9. miles from <hi>Saliſbury,</hi> at <hi>Maddington,</hi> which may better be called one of the wonders of this Land, then the <hi>Hawthorne-tree</hi> at <hi>Glaſſenbury,</hi> which ſuperſtition made ſo famous: for divers of the ſame kind are found elſewhere. You may find this graſſe briefly deſcribed in a Book called <hi>Phyto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logia</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:114859:7"/> 
                  <hi>Britannica,</hi> (which lately came forth, and ſet down even all the plants which have been found na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally growing in <hi>England Gramen Caninum Supinum Longiſſimum,</hi> which groweth 9. miles from <hi>Saliſbury,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tuckers</hi> at <hi>Maddington:</hi> where with they fat <hi>hogs;</hi> and which is 24. foot long, a thing almoſt incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; yet commonly known to all that Shire. Now without queſtion, if the ſeed of this graſſe, be ſowne in other rich Meadowes, it will yeeld extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily, though perchance not ſo much, as in its proper place. I wonder that thoſe that live there abouts, have not tryed to fertilize their other Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes with it: for it is a peculiar <hi>ſpecies</hi> of graſſe; and though ſome Ingenious men have found about 90. <hi>ſpecies</hi> of graſſes in this <hi>iſland:</hi> yet there is none like to this, that can by any meanes be brought to ſuch an height, and ſweetneſſe. And truly I ſuppoſe, that the thorough examination of this graſſe, is a thing of very great importance, for the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Meadowes</hi> and <hi>Paſtures;</hi> and it may excel the great <hi>Trefoile, Saint Foine, La Lucerne,</hi> or any <hi>exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> plant whatſoever. And though I am very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to exceed the bounds of an Epiſtle; yet I cannot but certifie you, wherein the <hi>Husbandry</hi> of this <hi>Nation</hi> in other particulars (as I ſuppoſe) is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deficient, which I will do as briefly as may be; and likewiſe, how ingenious men may finde <hi>Remedies</hi> for theſe <hi>deficiencies.</hi>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114859:8"/> beaten their braines about the perpetual Motion and other curioſities, that they might find the beſt wayes to eaſe all Motions, ſhould never ſo much as to honour the <hi>Plough</hi> (which is the moſt neceſſary Inſtrument in the world,) by their labour and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. I ſuppoſe all know, that it would be an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary benefit to this <hi>Countrey,</hi> if that 1. or 2. horſes could plough and draw as much as 4. or 6. and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo, that there is no ſmall difference in <hi>ploughs,</hi> and <hi>waggons,</hi> when there is ſcarce any ſure rule for the making them; and every <hi>Countrey,</hi> yea almoſt every <hi>County,</hi> differs not onely in the <hi>ploughs;</hi> but even in every part. Some with wheels, others with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; ſome turning the <hi>Rest</hi> (as they call it) as in <hi>Kent, Picardy</hi> and <hi>Normandy,)</hi> others not; ſome ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Coulters</hi> of one faſhion, others of another; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as the <hi>Dutch,</hi> having an Iron wheele or circle for that purpoſe; ſome having their <hi>ſheares</hi> broad at point; ſome not; ſome being round, as in <hi>Kent,</hi> others flat; ſometying their horſes by the taile, as in <hi>Ireland.</hi> So, likewiſe <hi>Waggons</hi> and <hi>Carts</hi> differ: ſome uſing 4. wheels, others two onely; ſome car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying timber on 2. wheeles in a Cart, others with 4. wheeles, and a long pole onely between, which is the beſt way; ſome plough with 2. horſes onely, as in <hi>Norfolke,</hi> and beyond ſeas in <hi>France, Italy,</hi> where I never ſaw above three horſes in a <hi>Plough,</hi> and one onely to hold and drive: but in <hi>Kent</hi> I have ſeen 4. 6. yea 12. horſes and oxen; which variety ſheweth, that the <hi>Husband-man,</hi> who is ordinarily ignorant in <hi>Mechanicks,</hi> is even at his wits end in this Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he muſt neceſſarily uſe continually. Surely he ſhould deſerve very well of this <hi>Nation,</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:114859:8"/> and be much honoured by all, that would ſet down exact <hi>Rules</hi> for the making of this moſt neceſſary, yet contemned <hi>Instrument,</hi> and for every part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: for without queſtion there are as exact Rules to be laid down for this, as for <hi>Shipping</hi> &amp; other things. And yet in <hi>Shipping,</hi> how have we within <hi>theſe</hi> 6. <hi>years</hi> out-ſtripped our ſelves, &amp; gone beyond all <hi>Nations?</hi> for which Art ſome deſerve eternal honour. And why may we not in this? I know a Gentleman, who now is beyond ſeas, where he excels even the <hi>Holland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> in their own buſineſſe of draining; who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed much in this kind, and I think, he is able to performe it; I could wiſh, he were called on to make good his promiſe. In <hi>China,</hi> it is ordinary to have waggons to paſſe up and down without horſes or Oxen, with ſailes as ſhips do: &amp; lately in <hi>Holland</hi> a waggon was framed, which with ordinary ſailes carryed 30. people 60. <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles in 4. houres. I know ſome excellent ſchollars, who promiſe much by the meanes of <hi>Horizontal ſailes (viz.)</hi> to have 3. or 4. Ploughs to go together; which ſhall likewiſe both ſowe and harrow. I dare not being ignorant in theſe high ſpeculations, engage my ſelfe to do much thereby; but wiſh theſe Gentlemen, whom I know to be extreamly ingenious, would attempt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, both for the ſatisfying of themſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. There is an ingenious <hi>Yeoman</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi> who hath 2. ploughs faſtened together very finely, by the which he plougheth 2. furrowes at once, one under another; and ſo ſtirreth up the land 12. or 14. inches deep, which in deep land is good. Neare <hi>Greenwich</hi> there liveth an <hi>Honourable Gentleman,</hi> who hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <note place="margin">Col. Blunt.</note> Corne on barren land, and yet plougheth his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114859:9"/> land with one horſe, when as uſually through <hi>Kent,</hi> they uſe 4. and 6. Theſe things ſhew that much may be done in this kinde; and I hope ſome in theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive times, wil undertake and accompliſh this work of ſo great importance.</p>
               <p>There is a Book long ſince Printed made by <hi>Sir</hi> 
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">2. <hi>Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, about digging of land, Setting and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of Corne.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Hugh Plattes,</hi> (the moſt curious man of his time) cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Adams Art revived,</hi> wherein is ſhewed the great benefit which would accrew to this Nation, if all land which were fit to be digg'd, were ſo ordered, and their corne ſet. Mr. <hi>Gab. Plattes</hi> likewiſe hath written much of this kind, and promiſeth that men ſhall reape 100. for one; all charges borne which are very great. That this may be true, he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſome probable <hi>Reaſons,</hi> ſuppoſing that leſſe then a peck of <hi>Wheat</hi> will ſet an Acre. I dare not promiſe ſo much as theſe <hi>Gentlemen</hi> do, neither can I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend M. <hi>Gab. Plattes</hi> ſetting Inſtrument: For I know there are many difficulties in it, which he himſelfe could never wade through; but concerning digging and ſetting and howing in of Corne, theſe things I dare maintaine.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is a deficiency in <hi>Husbandry,</hi> that it is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed no more.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That one good digging, becauſe it goeth deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Plough, and buryeth all weeds, killeth the graſſes; is as good as three ploughings, and if the Land be mellow, not much more chargeable.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it would imploy many 1000. of people, that a third part of the ſeed might be ſaved. As I have found by experience, that all the weeds and graſſes, might be more eaſily deſtroyed thereby, and the ground better accommodated for other
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114859:9"/> crops; and to conclude, the croppe conſiderably greater. Yet thus much I muſt further ſay, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſetting of Graine, That great <hi>Beanes</hi> are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of neceſſity to be ſet, and that ſmall <hi>Beanes</hi> in <hi>Surrey</hi> and other places, are likewiſe ſet with Profit, for the reaſons above mentioned; that to ſet <hi>Peaſe</hi> (unleſſe <hi>Hastevers) Oates, Barley,</hi> is a thing even ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous: that <hi>Wheate</hi> although in divers grounds it may be ſet with Profit; yet to <hi>Howe it in</hi> (as the <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diners</hi> ſpeak) as they do <hi>Peaſe,</hi> though not at the ſame diſtance, but about a foot the ranges one from another, is better then ſetting, for theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe to ſet Corne is an infinite trouble and charge; and if it be not very exactly done, which children neither can nor will do, and theſe muſt be the chiefe ſetters; will be very prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If wormes, froſt, ill weather, or fowles, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy any part of your ſeed, which they will do; your croppe is much impaired.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ground cannot be ſo well weeded, and the mould raiſed about the roots by the <hi>howe.</hi> Which 3. inconveniencies are remedied by the other way.</p>
               <p>Further I dare affirme, that after the ground is digged or ploughed and harrowed; even it's better to howe <hi>Wheate</hi> in, then to ſowe it after the <hi>common way;</hi> becauſe that the weeds may be eaſily deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by running the <hi>howe</hi> through it in the Spring, and the mould raiſed about the roots of the Corne, as the <hi>Gardiners</hi> do with <hi>Peaſe,</hi> it would ſave much Corne in deare yeares, and for other Reaſons before mentioned. Yea it is not more chargeable; for a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114859:10"/> 
                  <hi>Gardiner</hi> will <hi>howe in</hi> an Acre for 5. s. and after in the ſpring for leſs money runne it over with a howe, and cut up all the weeds, and raiſe the mould: which charges are not great, and you ſhall ſave above a buſhel of ſeed, which in deare years is more worth then all your charges.</p>
               <p>Further 1. s. 6. d. an Acre for the ſowing and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing of an Acre in <hi>Kent</hi> is accounted a reaſonable price; but if any feare charges let him uſe a <hi>Drill-Plough.</hi> I therefore cannot but commend the <hi>how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in</hi> of <hi>Wheate,</hi> as an excellent peece of good <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry,</hi> whether the ground be digged or plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; not onely becauſe it ſaveth much Corne, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployeth much people; and it is not chargeable; but it alſo deſtroyeth all weeds, fitteth grounds for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter crops, &amp; cauſeth a greater increaſe, and in my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion is a good <hi>Remedy</hi> againſt <hi>Smut</hi> and <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dew.</hi> There is an Ingenious <hi>Italian,</hi> who wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how it cometh to paſſe, that if one ſetteth a Graine of Corne, as <hi>Wheate, Barly,</hi> &amp;c. it uſually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth 300. or 400. as I have tryed: yet if you ſowe <hi>Wheate</hi> after the ordinary way, 6. or 8. for one is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a good crop; what becometh of all the Corne, that is <hi>ſown,</hi> when as the 50th. part, if it do grow, would be ſufficient? For anſwer to this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſay, much Corne is ſowne, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath deſtinated for the <hi>Hens</hi> and <hi>Chickens,</hi> being without any conſiderable vegetative faculty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wormes, Froſts, Floods, Crowes, and Larkes, (which every one doth not conſider) do devour not a little.</p>
               <p n="3">3, Weeds, as <hi>Poppie, May-weed,</hi> and the graſſes growing with the Corne, do deſtroy much.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:114859:10"/>
               <p> Laſtly, when Corne is ſo ſowne after the ordinary manner, much is buried in the furrowes; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if the ground be grazy: much is thrown on heaps in holes, and conſequently ſtarve and choake one another. Moſt of theſe Inconveniencies, are to be remedyed by this way of ſetting, and howing in of Corne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gardening,</hi> though it be a wonderfull improver of lands, as it plainly appears by this <note place="margin" type="runSum">3. <hi>Deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening.</hi>
                  </note> that they give extraordinary rates for land <hi>(viz.)</hi> from 40. s. <hi>per</hi> Acre to 9. pound, and dig and howe and dung their lands, which coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth very much; Yet I know divers, which by 2. or 3.

               <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is but of few years ſtanding in <hi>England,</hi> and therefore not deeply rooted. About 50. yeares ago, about which time <hi>Ingenuities</hi> firſt began to flouriſh in <hi>England;</hi> This <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Garden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> began to creepe into <hi>England,</hi> into <hi>Sandwich,</hi> and <hi>Surrey, Fulham,</hi> and other places.</p>
               <p>Some old men in <hi>Surrey,</hi> where it flouriſheth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much at preſent; report, That they knew the firſt <hi>Gardiners</hi> that came into thoſe parts, to plant <hi>Cabages, Colleflowers,</hi> and to ſowe <hi>Turneps, Carrets,</hi> and <hi>Parſnips,</hi> to ſowe <hi>Raith, Kape, Peaſe,</hi> all which at that time were great rarities, we having few, or none in <hi>England,</hi> but what came from <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Flaunders.</hi> Theſe <hi>Gardiners</hi> with much ado pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a plot of good ground, and gave no leſſe then
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114859:11"/> 8. pound <hi>per</hi> Acre; yet the <hi>Gentleman</hi> was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, fearing they would ſpoile his ground; becauſe they did uſe to dig it. So ignorant were we of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening in thoſe dayes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Many parts of <hi>England</hi> are as yet ignorant. Within theſe 20. years, a famous <hi>Towne</hi> within leſſe <note place="margin">Graveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end.</note> then 20. miles of <hi>London,</hi> had not ſo much as a meſſe of <hi>Peaſe</hi> but what came from <hi>London,</hi> where at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Gardening</hi> flouriſheth much. I could inſtance divers other places, both in the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>Weſt</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> where the name of <hi>Gardening,</hi> and <hi>Howing</hi> is ſcarcely knowne, in which places a few <hi>Gardiners</hi> might have ſaved the lives of many poor people, who have ſtarved theſe dear years.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We have not <hi>Gardening-ware</hi> in that plenty and cheapneſſe (unleſſe perhaps about <hi>London)</hi> as in <hi>Holland</hi> and other places, where they not onely feed themſelves with <hi>Gardiners</hi> ware, but alſo fat their <hi>Hogs</hi> and <hi>Cowes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. We have as yet divers things from beyond Seas, which the <hi>Gardiners</hi> may eaſily raiſe at home, though nothing nigh ſo much as formerly; for in <hi>Qu. Eliz.</hi> time, we had not onely our <hi>Gardiners</hi> ware from <hi>Holland,</hi> but alſo <hi>Cherries</hi> from <hi>Flaunders; Apples</hi> from <hi>France; Saffron, Licoriſh</hi> from <hi>Spaine; Hopps</hi> from the <hi>Low Countreys:</hi> And the <hi>Frenchman</hi> who writes the <hi>Treaſure Politick</hi> ſaith, that it's one of the great <hi>Deficiencies</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that <hi>Hopps</hi> will not grow, whereas now it is knowne, that <hi>Lico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, Saffron, Cherries, Apples, Peares, Hopps, Cabbages</hi> of <hi>England</hi> are the beſt in the world. Notwithſtanding we as yet want many things, as for <hi>example:</hi> We want <hi>Onions,</hi> very many coming to <hi>England</hi> from <hi>Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:114859:11"/> 
                  <hi>Spaine; Madder</hi> for dying cometh from <hi>Zurick-Sea</hi> by <hi>Zealand;</hi> we have <hi>Red Roſes</hi> from <hi>France; Anice-ſeeds, Fennell-ſeeds, Cumine, Caraway, Rice</hi> from <hi>Italy,</hi> which without queſtion would grow very well in divers moiſt lands in <hi>England;</hi> yea <hi>Sweet Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jorame, Barly,</hi> and <hi>Gromwell-ſeed, &amp; Virga Aurea,</hi> though they grow in our hedges in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Gardening</hi> is <hi>deficient</hi> in this particular: that we have not <hi>Nurceries</hi> ſufficient in this land, of <hi>Apples, Peares, Cherries, Vines, Cheſtnuts, Almonds;</hi> but Gentlemen are neceſſitated, to ſend to <hi>London</hi> many 100. miles for them.</p>
               <p>Briefly, for the advancement of this ingenuous calling, I onely deſire, that <hi>Induſtrious Gentlemen</hi> would be pleaſed to encourage ſome expert work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men into the places where they live, and to let them land at a reaſonable rate, and if they be poor and honeſt, to lend a little ſtock; they will ſoon ſee the benefit that will redound, not onely to themſelves, but alſo to all their neighbours, eſpecially the poor, who are not a little ſuſtained by the <hi>Gardiners</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Ingenuities.</p>
               <p>4. Our Husbandry is <hi>deficient</hi> in this, that we know not how to <hi>remedy</hi> the <hi>infirmities</hi> of our <hi>grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Corne;</hi> eſpecially <hi>Smut</hi> and <hi>Mildew,</hi> to inſtance in theſe two onely, which oftentimes bring great ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities to theſe Nations: <hi>Smut</hi> in wet years, <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewes</hi> in dry. Theſe diſtempers in Corne, are not onely in our Countrey; but alſo in other places. A learned Author ſaith, that <hi>Smuttyneſſe</hi> of corne, which maketh it ſmell like a <hi>Red Herring,</hi> was not <note place="margin">Helmont.</note> knowne in <hi>France,</hi> till about 1530. at which time the great foule diſeaſe began to break forth, which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114859:12"/> he conceiveth from hence to have ſome original; as alſo the campe-diſeaſe. <hi>Mildewes</hi> are very great in the Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> which oft ſtick to the ſithes of thoſe that mowe graſſe and Corne: and (God be thanked) we are not troubled with <hi>Locusts,</hi> which is a great flying <hi>Graſſe-hopper,</hi> nor <hi>Palmer-wormes,</hi> which is a kind of great black <hi>Catter-piller,</hi> nor with great <hi>haile</hi> in ſummer, nor with great <hi>drought,</hi> which ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleth the eare in the ſtalke; which <hi>Calamities</hi> in <hi>hot Countreyes,</hi> do very oft totally deſtroy the honeſt and patient <hi>Husband-man's</hi> labours: neither are we troubled with extreame <hi>colds,</hi> which in <hi>New-England</hi> and other cold <hi>Countreyes,</hi> do oft deſtroy the Corne. But to returne to our purpoſe.</p>
               <p>And firſt briefly to ſhew you my opinion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Cauſes of Smuttyneſſe.</hi> I deſire not to fetch <hi>Cauſes</hi> a farre off, and to tell you of the ſad <hi>Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Saturn</hi> (for I think, <hi>Quae ſupraenos,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long not to us) when as we have enough at home: This is certain, ethat there are many evident <hi>Cauſes</hi> of this corruption of Corn.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A moiſt ſeaſon about <hi>Kerning-time:</hi> which moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture either corrupteth the roots of the Plant, or the nouriſhment of it, or the ſeed in its <hi>Embrio:</hi> or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in ſome meaſure all theſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Low, moiſt, foggy ground, for the reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Dung'd land. In <hi>Vineyards</hi> it's obſerved, that dung cauſeth more increaſe in quantity, but leſſe in goodneſſe, ſo that the ill taſte of the dung may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be diſcerned; becauſe wine hath an high taſte, without queſtion the ſame happeneth to other Plants, although it be not ſo eaſily diſcerned for the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114859:12"/> ferment or ill odour of the dung, cannot be over-maſtered by the Plants, as wee ſee alſo in <hi>Animals,</hi> that corrupt diet cauſeth unfavory taſtes in the fleſh: ſo <hi>hogs</hi> in <hi>New found-land,</hi> were they are nouriſhed by <hi>fiſh,</hi> may by their <hi>taſtes</hi> be called rather <hi>Sea-porpuſſes,</hi> then <hi>Land-ſwine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The ſowing of <hi>Smutty</hi> Corne oft produceth <hi>Smuttyneſſe;</hi> the Son like unto the father; I account <hi>Smutty</hi> Corne an <hi>imperfect</hi> or <hi>ſick</hi> Graine, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that by a <hi>Microſcope</hi> the imperfection may be diſcerned.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the ſowing of the ſame ſeed oft on the ſame field, cauſeth <hi>Smuttyneſſe;</hi> becauſe that <hi>nitrous juice,</hi> which is convenient for the nouriſhment of the Graine, hath been exhauſted in the precedent years; and therefore it is excellent <hi>Husbandry</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year to change the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Graine, and alſo to buy your Seed-Corne, from places farre diſtant. I am informed of a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> who did ſowe ſome <hi>Wheate</hi> which came from <hi>Spaine,</hi> where the Graine is uſually very hard and flinty, and as it were tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparent, and farre weightier then ours (as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by a meaſure at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> which holdeth about 3. buſhels, and if our <hi>Wheat</hi> in the <hi>Northerne</hi> parts weigheth 160. the <hi>Southerne</hi> Corne weigheth ſometimes 180. 200. 220:) and had a crop beyond expectation.</p>
               <p>The uſuall <hi>Cures</hi> of <hi>Smuttyneſſe,</hi> beſides thoſe mentioned before, are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To lime your ground, which warmeth and dryeth the land.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To lime your Corne, which is done thus. Firſt ſlack your lime, and then moiſten your Corne or
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114859:13"/> lime, and ſtirre them together till your Graine be as big as a ſmall <hi>Peaſe.</hi> This liming preſerveth Corne likewiſe from birds and wormes, and is found a very good <hi>Remedy</hi> againſt this diſeaſe: others make a ſtrong ly with common ſalt, and ſteepe their Corne in it all night, and then draw away their ly for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe; which ſeldome faileth of its deſired effect. Whether this ſtrong ly doth by its <hi>corroſivenes,</hi> mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the weake and imperfect Corne, ſo that it will not grow; Or whether it be a <hi>Remedy,</hi> to cure the imperfections thereof, is worth the enquiry? I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that this ly doth <hi>exſiccate</hi> the <hi>ſuperfluous humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> which is the cauſe of this corruption. If Corne be brought into the barne very <hi>Smutty,</hi> in <hi>Kent</hi> they uſually thraſh it on dry floores planked with boards; by which meanes, the <hi>Smuttyneſſe</hi> is beaten away, and ſticketh not to the Graine, onely a little blacknes appeareth about the eye, but if it be thraſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a moiſt floore, the blackneſſe ſticketh to the graine, which therefore appeareth darke, and is ſold at a lower rate to the Bakers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mildew</hi> is without queſtion an <hi>unctuous</hi> dew, which deſcendeth from above, about <hi>Midſommer;</hi> it aboundeth in dry years, as <hi>Smuttyneſſe in</hi> moiſt. I cannot thinke that there is ordinarily any Maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this dew, but it produceth its effect by mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt cauſes, <hi>viz.</hi> from an <hi>oily viſcous</hi> quality which ſtoppeth the <hi>pores</hi> of the husk wherein the <hi>Wheate</hi> lyeth, and depriveth it from the Aire, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently from nouriſhment: for the Aire is the life of all things. I have heard and do beleeve, that if you ſtreake any eare of <hi>Wheat</hi> with oile, it will produce the ſame effect. I am ſorry that I never
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114859:13"/> tryed, that I might better underſtand the nature of this ſad calamity; which often undoeth the Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious <hi>Husband-man;</hi> and cauſeth great ſcarcity in this <hi>Iſle.</hi> It is to be obſerved further, that <hi>Wheat</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffereth conſiderable damage by <hi>Mildew;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it lyeth in a chaffy husk, which other Graines do not. The <hi>Grounds</hi> moſt ſubject to <hi>Mildew</hi> are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thoſe that are <hi>incloſed</hi> with <hi>trees</hi> and <hi>high hedges.</hi> And truly this is the onely great <hi>Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency</hi> I find by <hi>encloſures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Lowe velleyes.</hi> I have ſeen very oft in the ſame field, the bankes fine, bright Corne; and all the <hi>lower</hi> parts, though greater in <hi>ſtraw;</hi> yet little worth by reaſon of the <hi>Mildew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Dung</hi> made of <hi>ſtraw,</hi> I have obſerved to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe much to <hi>Mildew,</hi> and <hi>Sheeps-dung</hi> to be a kind of <hi>Antidote</hi> againſt it: as alſo <hi>Pigeons-dung;</hi> becauſe, as I conceive, theſe, 2. laſt ſorts abound much in <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> which produceth a firme, hard, bright Corne, not eaſily to be putrefyed; but the other being more oily and <hi>Sulphureous</hi> cauſeth a darke <hi>Spungy</hi> Corn, ſoon corruptible. And 2. Becauſe <hi>straw</hi> is a part of the ſame kind corrupted which is alwayes in ſome meaſure hurtfull to the ſame <hi>ſpecies</hi> both in <hi>Ammals</hi> and all <hi>Vegetables;</hi> and therefore <hi>rotten ſticks</hi> or the <hi>earth</hi> proceeding from them, is found hurtful to the <hi>roots</hi> of <hi>trees;</hi> and <hi>trees</hi> will hardly grow, where the <hi>Roots</hi> of other <hi>trees</hi> have formerly been <hi>corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Remedyes</hi> for this <hi>Accident,</hi> briefly are theſe. (Not to ſpeak of <hi>Bees,</hi> who queſtionleſſe make moſt of their <hi>Honey</hi> from theſe <hi>Honies</hi> or <hi>Mildews:</hi> for they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114859:14"/> gather very little, in compariſon of that which fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.)</p>
               <p n="1">1. The beſt way is to cut down the trees about your ground, and your hedges low, that the wind may <hi>ventilate</hi> your Corne.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To ſowe early; that your Corne may be full <hi>Kerned,</hi> before theſe <hi>Mildewes</hi> fall. I am informed, <note place="margin">Sir Jo. Culp.</note> that an Ingenious <hi>Kt.</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> did for curioſity ſowe <hi>Wheate</hi> in all moneths of the year and that the Corne ſowen in <hi>July,</hi> did produce ſuch an increaſe, that it is almoſt incredible; and truly I think it a great fault in many places, that they ſowe late, for many reaſons: I am ſure in <hi>France,</hi> they uſually ſowe before <hi>Michaelmas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Some uſe (and with good profit) to draw a line over their Corne, and to ſtrike off the <hi>Mildew,</hi> before it be <hi>inſpiſſated</hi> by the Sun; This ought eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to be done before ſun-riſing: 2. men in an hour will eaſily run over an Acre; the <hi>Mildewes</hi> uſually fall like a <hi>thick fog,</hi> or a <hi>Misty raine;</hi> if you go to your <hi>Bees,</hi> you will ſoon perceive it by their extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry labour, very early in the morning.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The uſe of a kind of <hi>bearded Wheate,</hi> is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Remedy:</hi> for the beard ſhoveth off the <hi>dew,</hi> that it doth not ſo eaſily inſinuate it ſelfe into the <hi>eare,</hi> and likewiſe cauſeth the <hi>eare</hi> to ſhake by the leaſt wind. There is a kind of <hi>Wheate</hi> in <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham-Shire</hi> called <hi>Red-straw-Wheate,</hi> which is much commended: it's a ſtrong-ſtalked <hi>Wheate,</hi> and doth not ſoon lodge, and therefore excellent for <hi>Rank</hi> land, where Corne is apt to lodge, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Mildew;</hi> but I queſtion whether it hath any property againſt <hi>Mildew.</hi> This I am very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114859:14"/> of, that if this <hi>Wheate,</hi> or any other, were without the Chaffy huskes expoſed bare to the Aire; as <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>Rie</hi> are, <hi>Wheate</hi> would not be afflicted with <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dew:</hi> Perhaps ſuch Graine may be found by diligent enquiry. I have caſually picked out of a <hi>Wheate-field</hi> ſome ſtalkes, which have had 2. eares on them: and though <hi>Barly</hi> uſually hath been 2. ranges; yet I have ſeen ſome ſorts with 4. 6. and there are many great varieties in graines not yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. Truly, if any one knoweth better wayes then theſe, how to cure this Malady of <hi>Mildew,</hi> he is much to blame, if he do not publiſh it for the good of his <hi>Countreymen,</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Graftings</hi> and <hi>Inoculations,</hi> which nevertheleſſe is an art abſolutely neceſſary in Planting; for every book of <hi>Husbandry</hi> doth ſhew it, and every <hi>Gardiner</hi> can teach it thoſe who are deſirous to learn it; Neither will I ſet down all the ſorts of <hi>Apples, Peares, Cherries, Plums,</hi> &amp;c. for it would be too tedious a diſcourſe; and Mr. <hi>Parkinſon</hi> hath already very excellently done it, in his Book called <hi>Paradiſus Terreſtris,</hi> where at leaſure you may read it. I will onely point brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the <hi>Deficiencies,</hi> which I find in this part of <hi>Husbandry,</hi> and the beſt wayes to <hi>Remedy</hi> them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſay, that it is a great <hi>Deficiency</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> that we have not more <hi>Orchards</hi> planted. It's true, that in <hi>Kent</hi> and about <hi>London,</hi> and alſo in <hi>Gloucester-Shire, Herford,</hi> and <hi>Worcester,</hi> there are many gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant <hi>Orchards,</hi> but in other <hi>Countreys,</hi> they are very rare, and thinne: but if there were as many more, even in any <hi>Countrey,</hi> they would be very profitable. I know in <hi>Kent,</hi> that ſome advance their ground e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:114859:15"/> from 5. s. <hi>per</hi> Acre to 5. pound by this meanes, and if I ſhould relate, what I have heard by divers concerning the profit of a <hi>Cherry-Orchard,</hi> about <hi>Sittenburne</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> you would hardly beleeve me; yet I have heard it by ſo many, that I beleeve it to be true: Namely; that an <hi>Orchard</hi> of 30. Acres of <hi>Cherryes,</hi> produduced in one year above a 1000. pound, but now the trees are almoſt all dead; it was one of the firſt <hi>Orchards</hi> planted in <hi>Kent.</hi> Mr. <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> reporteth, that the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Leicester's</hi> Gardiner in <hi>Qu. Eliz.</hi> time, firſt began to plant <hi>Flemiſh Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes</hi> in thoſe parts; which in his time did ſpread in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to 16. other <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> and were at that time ſold at rgeater rates then now; yet I know that 10. or 15. pound an Acre hath been given for <hi>Cherryes,</hi> more for <hi>Pears,</hi> and <hi>Apples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a great <hi>Deficiency</hi> in the ordering of <hi>Orchards,</hi> in that they are not well pruned, but full of <hi>Moſſe, Miſletoe,</hi> and <hi>Suckers,</hi> and oftentimes the ground is packed too thick of trees; for they ſhould ſtand at leaſt 20. foot aſunder; neither will ill husbands beſtow dunging, digging, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther coſt on <hi>Orchards,</hi> which if they did, might pay halfe their rents in ſome places. One told me for a ſecret, a Compoſition for to make Trees bear much and excellent fruit, which was this: Firſt in an old tree, to <hi>ſplit</hi> his root; then to apply a <hi>Compoſt</hi> made of <hi>Pigeons-dung lees</hi> of wine, or ſtale <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> and a little <hi>Brimſtone,</hi> (to deſtroy the wormes,) it hath ſome probability of truth: for experience I know, that a buſhel of <hi>Pigeons-dung,</hi> hath cauſed a tree to grow and bear, which for divers years before ſtood at a ſtand; but concerning <hi>ſplitting the roots,</hi> I know
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:114859:15"/> not what to ſay. Some old <hi>Authors</hi> affirm this ought to be done; becauſe that the roots may as wel be hide-bound, as other parts of the tree, and not able to attract his nouriſhment, and when the Roote is ſplit, it will ſpeedily ſend forth divers ſmall <hi>fibrous</hi> roots, which are the principal <hi>Attractors.</hi> It were good that ſome would give us an exact account of this <hi>Experiment.</hi> But Some will object againſt <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards,</hi> that they ſpoile much ground, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to be planted onely in <hi>hedges.</hi> To this I anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Plumtrees</hi> and <hi>Damſins,</hi> may very well be planted in hedges, being ordinarily thorny plants; this is uſed very much in <hi>Surrey</hi> and <hi>Kent,</hi> where the <hi>Plums</hi> uſually pay no ſmall part of their Rent; yet I never ſaw in theſe <hi>Southerne</hi> parts of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> any <hi>Apples</hi> or <hi>Peares</hi> thrive in an <hi>Hedge,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe a <hi>Crab</hi> or a <hi>Wilden,</hi> or ſome <hi>Sweeting</hi> of little worth. How they thrive in <hi>Hereford-Shire</hi> and thoſe places, I know not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Inconveniences</hi> of <hi>Orchards,</hi> planted at 20. or 30. foot diſtance, is not worth ſpeaking of: for this is the uſuall courſe in <hi>Kent,</hi> when they plant any ground, they exactly place them in ranke and file, and then plough their lands many years, and ſow them with Corn, till the <hi>Orchard</hi> beginneth to beare fruite; then they lay them down for <hi>paſture,</hi> which <hi>Paſture</hi> is not conſiderably <hi>ſoure;</hi> but hath this advantage above other <hi>Paſtures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is ſooner growne by 14. dayes in the ſpring than the <hi>Medowes,</hi> and therefore very ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In <hi>Parching Summers</hi> here is <hi>plenty,</hi> when other places have Scarcity</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:114859:16"/> 3. They are great ſhelters for Cattel, eſpecially <hi>Sheepe,</hi> who will in thoſe places, in great ſnowes ſcrape up meate, which in other places they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do: and if the paſture were <hi>ſoure;</hi> yet the loſſe is not great; for it will be a convenient place for the <hi>Hogs</hi> to run in, who muſt have a place for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, where there are no Commons.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I ſay, that the <hi>Benefits</hi> are ſo many by <hi>Orchards,</hi> that you ought not like an ungrateful man to thruſt them up to the hedge: for they afford curious walkes for pleaſure, food for Cattel, both in the <hi>ſpring</hi> ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and alſo in the <hi>parching Summer,</hi> and <hi>nipping ſnowy Winter:</hi> They affoard fuel for the fire, and alſo ſhades from the heat, phyſick for the ſicke, refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the ſound, plenty of food for man, and that not of the worſt, and drink alſo even of the beſt, and all this without much labour, care, or coſt, who therefore can juſtly open his mouth againſt them?</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Deficiency</hi> is, that we do not improve many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Fruits, which grow amongſt us very well, and that we have as yet many fruits from beyond ſeas, which will grow very well with us. I paſſe by the generall and great ignorance, that is amongſt us, of the variety of <hi>Apples,</hi> of which there are many ſorts, which have ſome good and peculiar uſes; moſt men contenting themſelves with the knowledge of half a ſcore of the beſt, thinking the vertues of all the reſt are comprehended in them: as alſo of the variety of <hi>Pears,</hi> which are incredibly many. A <hi>Friend</hi> of mine neare <hi>Graveſend,</hi> hath lately collected about 200. <hi>ſpecies.</hi> I know another in <hi>Eſſex</hi> (Mr. <hi>Ward)</hi> who hath nigh the ſame number. I heare of another in <hi>Worcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-Shire,</hi> not inferiour to theſe in <hi>Northamton-Shire.</hi> I
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114859:16"/> know one, who hath likewiſe collected very many. So that I dare boldly ſay, there are no leſſe in this <hi>Iſland</hi> then 500. <hi>ſpecies;</hi> ſome commended for their early ripeneſſe; ſome for excellent taſtes; ſome for beauty; others for greatnes; ſome for great bearers; others for good Bakers; ſome for long laſters; other for to make <hi>Perry,</hi> &amp;c. But to our purpoſe: I ſay many rare Fruits are neglected; to Inſtance.</p>
               <p n="1">1. in the <hi>Small-nut</hi> and <hi>Filbird,</hi> which is not much inferiour to the beſt and ſweeteſt <hi>Almonds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The great <hi>Damſin</hi> or <hi>Pruin-Plum,</hi> which groweth well and beareth full in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Almonds,</hi> which groweth well and beareth good fruit, as I have ſeen divers buſhels on one tree in my brothers <hi>Orchard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Wal-nuts,</hi> which is not a fruit to be deſpiſed.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Vines,</hi> and <hi>Mulberries,</hi> but of theſe preſently in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place. I might likewiſe add <hi>Currants, Raſpeſes,</hi> of which excellent drinkes may be made.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Quinces,</hi> of the which I cannot but tell you that a <hi>Gentleman</hi> at <hi>Prichenell</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who had a tree from beyond Sea, hath the beſt in <hi>England,</hi> and hath made above 30. pound of a ſmall peece of ground planted with them, as I have heard from his own wifes mouth. And therefore it is by reaſon of our ill <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry,</hi> that we have <hi>Quinces</hi> from <hi>Flaunders, Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts</hi> from <hi>Spaine, Pruins</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> and alſo <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts</hi> and <hi>Almonds</hi> from <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Cheſtnuts</hi> (which I had almoſt forgot) from <hi>Portugall.</hi> And now I cannot but digreſſe a little, to tell you a ſtrange and true ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, with my opinion of it. In divers places of <hi>Kent,</hi> as at and about <hi>Graveſend,</hi> in the Countrey and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, very many of the prime <hi>Timbers</hi> of their old barnes and houſes are of <hi>Cheſtnut-wood,</hi> and yet
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114859:17"/> there is ſcarce a <hi>Cheſtnut-tree</hi> within 20. miles of that place, and the people altogether ignorant of ſuch trees. This ſheweth that in former times thoſe places did abound with ſuch timber; for people were not ſo fooliſh ſurely in former times, to runne up and down the world, to procure ſuch huge ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtey timbers for barnes and ſuch buildings when as there was plenty of <hi>Oakes,</hi> and <hi>Elmes,</hi> at their doors: And further, it ſheweth, that theſe Trees will grow again with us to a great bigneſſe. This putteth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my minde, the ſtory of the <hi>moore-logs,</hi> which are found in divers places of the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>moores</hi> many foot deepe; which logs are long and black, and appeare to be a kinde of <hi>Firre,</hi> or <hi>Pine;</hi> and yet in thoſe places, people are altogether ignorant of theſe Trees, the Country not producing any of theſe <hi>ſpecies.</hi> The firſt ſtory of <hi>Kent,</hi> which I know to be true, cauſeth me to wonder the leſſe at the latter: for I ſee that a <hi>ſpecies</hi> of wood, may be deſtroyed, even totally in a place. And</p>
               <p>2. I know, that in <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>New-England,</hi> that <hi>Pines</hi> and <hi>Firres</hi> and <hi>Cedars,</hi> do grow wonderfully thick in ſuch <hi>Moores</hi> or <hi>Swamps,</hi> and being light wood, and eaſily wrought, they are continually u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, while they laſt, for buildings. Further, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, theſe <hi>Moores,</hi> are <hi>Commons,</hi> to the which the poore have uſed to reſort for firing, and how ſoon great woods will be conſumed by them, every one making what havock he pleaſeth, all men know. As concerning their being ſo deepe in the ground, and blackneſſe; I ſuppoſe that when wood, was abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in thoſe places, every one did cut what they pleas'd, and left what was not for their turnes,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:114859:17"/> which being in moiſt places, was ſoon glutted with moiſture, and made ponderous; by which meanes it ſoon buried it ſelfe, as ſhips do, on quickſand, or perhaps the <hi>turffe</hi> (which hath a peculiar faculty vegetative, for where it is exhauſted, it ſoon grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againe) in time hath growne over them; the people permitting it, becauſe that wood, once <hi>ſobb'd</hi> in wet, is of little uſe, as we ſee by <hi>Piles</hi> on the <hi>marſhes-ſide,</hi> ſcarce any man vouchſafing to carry them home. The blackneſſe of this wood proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, as I ſuppoſe, from the ſooty fume, or <hi>evaporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the black <hi>turffe,</hi> which endeavoureth, as all earths do, to reduce all things into it's own nature; which though it be not able fully to accompliſh; yet it introduceth divers diſpoſitions, and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as blackneſſe in the wood. Some ſuppoſe, that theſe <hi>moore-logs</hi> have laine there ever ſince the <hi>flood,</hi> with whom I will not contend; ſeeing that any wood, if it be kept from the Aire continually moiſt or dry, will endure even thouſands of yeares with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out putrefaction.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Deficiency,</hi> is the <hi>Not-improving</hi> of our <hi>Fruits</hi> for the beſt ends and purpoſes. <hi>Normandy,</hi> which <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>The</hi> 6. <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our Fruits.</hi>
                  </note> produceth but little wine, maketh abundance of <hi>Cider</hi> and <hi>Perry,</hi> which they eſtimate equally to wine, if it be made of good fruit. The ordinary <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> is made of <hi>Choaky Peares,</hi> very juicy, which growe along by the high-way-ſides, which are not to be eaten raw. In <hi>Biſcay</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> where wine is ſcarce, they make <hi>Cider</hi> of a certaine ſweet <hi>Apple,</hi> which hath a little <hi>bitternes</hi> in it, and is like to our <hi>ſnonting,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Cider</hi> is very good. And truly here in <hi>England,</hi> if we would make <hi>Cider</hi> and <hi>Perry</hi> of the beſt ſorts
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:114859:18"/> of Fruits, which is rarely done, (for we think any fruit good enough for that purpoſe) we might make drinks no wayes inferiour to the <hi>French wines,</hi> which are uſually ſpoyled before they come over the ſeas to you, their ſpirits ſoon evaporating. There are two wayes of making <hi>Cider</hi> and <hi>Perry:</hi> one, by bruiſing and beating them, and then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to put them into a veſſel to <hi>ferment</hi> or worke (as it is uſually called) of themſelves: The other way, is to boile the juice with ſome good <hi>ſpices,</hi> by which the rawneſſe is taken away, and then to ferment it with ſome yeſt, if it worke not of it ſelf, this is the beſt way: and I have taſted <hi>Cider</hi> thus made of an excellent delicate taſte. Neither let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny complaine of the windineſſe; for it is onely want of uſe: When I had for 2. or 3. years continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally drunk <hi>wine</hi> beyond Sea, the ſtrongeſt beer for 2. or. 3. weekes, was as windy to me, as <hi>Cider</hi> will be to any; and afterward when I went to <hi>Paris,</hi> the <hi>wine</hi> of that place was as troubleſome as <hi>Engliſh beer</hi> for a little time: how much wine might be ſaved and alſo <hi>malt</hi> if <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> did take theſe good courſes, which other <hi>Nations</hi> do, and conſequently how much advantage would this <hi>Iſland</hi> reape there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by? If I were an houſe-keeper in the Countrey, I would make excellent <hi>Beere, Ale, Cider, Perry, Metheg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, Wine,</hi> of our own <hi>grapes,</hi> and if my Friends would not drink theſe, they ſhould drinke water, or go away a thirſt: I would ſcorne to honour <hi>France</hi> ſo much as men do uſually; and the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian</hi> ſhould not laugh at us, and ſay that we can as well be without <hi>bread,</hi> as their <hi>wines, Currents &amp;c.</hi> Thus may many other <hi>excellent drinks</hi> bemade out of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:114859:18"/> our <hi>Fruits:</hi> not to ſpeak of thoſe which are made of our <hi>Graine,</hi> as <hi>Barly, Wheate,</hi> &amp;c. yet I muſt tell you, that I know an <hi>Ingenious</hi> man, who can without malting <hi>Barly,</hi> make a <hi>drink</hi> not inferiour to <hi>wine,</hi> and a greater quantity of <hi>Aqua-vitae</hi> out of them, and with leſſe coſt, then by the ordinary way, by a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar <hi>fermentation</hi> of his own; which time will diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. There is another <hi>Ingeuious</hi> man, who out of <hi>Damſins,</hi> and other fat and ſweet <hi>plums,</hi> can make a <hi>drinke</hi> not inferiour to the beſt <hi>wines,</hi> and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <hi>Aqua-vitae.</hi> Many <hi>Ladies</hi> know how to make <hi>Cherry, Raſpes-wines;</hi> and Sir <hi>Hugh Plattes</hi> in his <hi>Cloſet for Ladies,</hi> diſcloſeth many ſecrets of this kind; as alſo for <hi>Conſerves, Marmalades,</hi> which are things both delightful and profitable. I have a kinſman, who can even out of <hi>black-berries,</hi> make a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant <hi>drinke,</hi> which curioſity he is unwilling to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh. <hi>Glauber</hi> an excellent <hi>Chymiſt</hi> hath divers ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of this kind, even to the advancing of <hi>Hawes, Hips, Canker-Berries, Slowes,</hi> to excellent <hi>Aqua-vitae's, drinkes, vinegers,</hi> which he himſelfe firſt invented. In <hi>Ruſſia</hi> in the <hi>ſpring-time</hi> it's an uſual cuſtome to pierce the barke of the <hi>Birch-trees,</hi> which at that time will weepe much <hi>liquor,</hi> and yet like children be little the worſe; this the poor ordinarily drinke for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, <note place="margin">Helmont</note> it's a pleaſant healthful drinke; and alſo the rich men, becauſe it's an excellent preſervative a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtone.</p>
               <p>The <hi>meanes</hi> to advance this profitable and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant worke, are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To advance <hi>Nurceries</hi> of all ſorts of <hi>Peares, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Plums, Cherries,</hi> which <hi>Gentlemen</hi> may do for a ſmal matter, and then plant out theſe trees, when
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:114859:19"/> they are growne great enough. The beſt and cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt wayes to raiſe all <hi>Nurcery</hi> wares is done thus. <hi>Plums</hi> may be raiſed either of <hi>ſtones,</hi> which when you have eaten the <hi>plums,</hi> may be preſently pricked into the ground, or by <hi>Slips,</hi> which you will find about the old trees. <hi>Apples</hi> may be raiſed from <hi>Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels (Crab kernels</hi> are the beſt) which ought to be preſerved in dry ſand, till the <hi>ſpring,</hi> leaſt they grow mouldy: or <hi>Crab-ſtalke</hi> may be fetched out of the woods, and grafted. Some Trees as <hi>Sweetings, Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, Quinces,</hi> will grow very well of <hi>ſlips. Cherries</hi> are very well raiſed by <hi>ſtones,</hi> (the <hi>Black-Cherries</hi> are the beſt) which ſo ſoone as you have eaten them, are to be howen into Beds made very fine, the ranges a foot diſtant; beware leaſt you let them heate, and take heed of the mouſe. I have ſeen <hi>Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-ſtones</hi> and <hi>Apple-Kernels</hi> grow 2. foot and a half in one yeare; and conſequently in few years they would be fit to be tranſplanted. The <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Grafting, Inoculating</hi> a Gentleman will learne in two houres.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the advancing of <hi>Ingenuities</hi> in this kind, as that making of <hi>Vinous-Drinks,</hi> out of <hi>Apples, Plums</hi> &amp;c. I counſel all <hi>Ingenious Gentlemen</hi> to try divers <hi>experiments</hi> in theſe kinds; with theſe <hi>Cautions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That he attempt not great quantities at firſt, which perchance will be chargeable and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; for by a gallon he may have as much certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as by a hogſhead.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Not to be diſcouraged, if they ſucceed not well at firſt daſh: for certainly there are many <hi>Ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> in theſe fruits, which time will diſcover.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Proceed by <hi>fermentation:</hi> for every liquour which will ferment, hath a <hi>vinous</hi> ſpirit in it, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:114859:19"/> 
                  <hi>fermentation</hi> even the beſt fruits will have none.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>fermentation</hi> is done either <hi>in liquido,</hi> or <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mido;</hi> and herein conſiſts ſome Myſtery. I have forgot to ſpeake of <hi>Apricocks, Peaches, Melicotores,</hi> which are fine pleaſant fruits, yet very dangerous; and therefore called by the <hi>Italians, Mazzofranceſe,</hi> that is, <hi>Kill-Frenchman;</hi> and wiſh Ladies, and others to take heed of ſurfeiting by theſe and ſome other dangerous plums.</p>
               <p>I cannot without much tediouſneſſe, relate the diverſe ſorts of <hi>Vines,</hi> which are even Infinite; <note place="margin" type="runSum">

               <p>And firſt, although I thinke that the <hi>wine</hi> is the great bleſſing of God, which <hi>Hot Countreys</hi> eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoy, as <hi>temperate Countryes</hi> do <hi>Milke, Butter, Cheeſe</hi> in abundance, and the coldeſt and <hi>Barrenneſt Fowle,</hi> &amp; <hi>Fiſh</hi> in an incredible number; God of his goodnes diſtributing ſome peculiar bleſſings to every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; Notwithſtanding I dare ſay, it's probable, that <hi>Vineyards</hi> have formerly <hi>flouriſhed</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> &amp; that we are to blame, that ſo little is attempted to revive them againe. There are many places in <hi>Kent</hi> called by the names of <hi>Vineyards,</hi> and the ground's of ſuch a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114859:20"/> Nature, that it ſeemeth probable, they have been ſuch. I heare further by divers, people of credit, that by records it appeareth, that the tithes of <hi>wine</hi> in <hi>Glocesterſhire</hi> was in divers Pariſhes conſiderably great; but at length <hi>Gaſcony</hi> coming into the hands of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> from whence cometh the moſt of the <hi>ſtrong French wine,</hi> call'd <hi>high-Countrey-wine,</hi> and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes being ſmall, <hi>wine</hi> was imported into <hi>England</hi> from thence, better and cheaper then we could make it, and it was thought convenient to diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age <hi>Vineyards</hi> here, that the greater trade might be driven with <hi>Gaſcoine,</hi> and many ſhips might finde imployment thereby.</p>
               <p>Some fond Aſtrologers have conceited, that the earth being growne older and therefore colder, hath cauſed the ſun to deſcende many degrees lower to warme and Cheriſh it, and one argument which they bring for this opinion is, that <hi>Vines</hi> and <hi>Silke-wormes</hi> are found in thoſe Countreyes, wherein for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times they were unknowne: But if theſe fond men, had conſidered the good <hi>Husbandry</hi> in theſe times, with the bleſſing of God on it, they had not run into ſuch fooliſh imaginations. This is true indeed, that the <hi>Roman</hi> ſouldiers, who had <hi>Alſatia</hi> given them to live in, which is one of the beſt and moſt <hi>Southerne</hi> places of <hi>Germany,</hi> mutined; becauſe they thought it ſo <hi>cold,</hi> that <hi>Vines</hi> would not grow there, and that therefore they ſhould be deprived of that delectable liquor; whereas we find at this preſent day <hi>Vines</hi> flouriſhing many hundred miles more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>North,</hi> both in <hi>France, Loraine,</hi> and <hi>Germany;</hi> and that they are crept down even to the <hi>latitude</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> for the <hi>Reniſh-wines</hi> grew within a degree
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:114859:20"/> of the <hi>Weſt-Southern</hi> places of this Iſle, &amp; <hi>Paris</hi> is not 2. degrees <hi>South</hi> of us, yet <hi>Vines</hi> grow three ſcore miles on this ſide <hi>Paris,</hi> at <hi>Beaumont;</hi> yea the <hi>Vines</hi> of theſe places are the moſt delicate; for what <hi>wine</hi> is preferred before the neat <hi>Reniſh</hi> for Ladies, and at table; and truly in my opinion, though I have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled twice through <hi>France;</hi> yet no <hi>wine</hi> pleaſed me like <hi>Vin D'ache</hi> &amp; <hi>of Paris;</hi> eſpecially about <hi>Rueill,</hi> which is a very fine <hi>brisk wine,</hi> &amp; not <hi>fuming</hi> up to the head, and <hi>Inebriating</hi> as other <hi>wines:</hi> I ſay therefore that it is very probable, that if <hi>Vines</hi> have ſtept out of <hi>Italy</hi> into <hi>Alſatia,</hi> from them to theſe places, which are even as farre <hi>North</hi> as <hi>England,</hi> and yet the <hi>wines</hi> there are the moſt delicate, that they are not limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and bounded there. For a 100. miles more or leſſe cauſeth little alteration in heat or cold, and ſome advantages which we have will ſupply that defect. But not to inſiſt too long on <hi>probabilities,</hi> Iſay, that herein <hi>England</hi> ſome <hi>Ingenious Gentlemen</hi> uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally make <hi>wine</hi> very good, long laſting, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary labour &amp; coſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s. To inſtance in one, who in great <hi>Chart</hi> in the <hi>Wilde of Kent,</hi> a place very moiſt and cold, yearly maketh 6. or 8. hogs-heads, which is very much commended by divers who have taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and he hath kept ſome of it 2. yeares, as he <note place="margin">Sir Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card.</note> himſelfe told me, and it hath been very good; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers likewiſe in <hi>Kent</hi> do the ſame: and lately in <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey a Gentle-woman</hi> told me, that they having many <hi>grapes,</hi> which they could not well tell how to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe off, ſhe, to play the good <hi>Houſe-wife,</hi> ſtampt them to make <hi>verjuice;</hi> but 2. moneths after drawing it forth, they found it very fine brisk <hi>wine,</hi> cleere like <hi>Rock-water,</hi> and in many other places ſuch <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> have been made. I therefore deſire <hi>Ingenious</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:114859:21"/> men to endeavour the raiſing of ſo neceſſary &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant a commodity; eſpecially when <hi>French Wine</hi> is ſo deare here, and I ſuppoſe is likely to be dearer, I queſtion not, but they ſhall finde good profit &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in ſo doing, and that the <hi>State</hi> will give all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to them: and if the <hi>French Wine</hi> pay <hi>excize</hi> and <hi>cuſtomes,</hi> and the <hi>Wines</hi> here be <hi>toll-free,</hi> they will be able to affoard them far cheaper, than the <hi>French</hi> can theirs, and ſupply the whole <hi>Iſle,</hi> if they proceede according to theſe <hi>Rules.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. To chooſe the beſt ſorts of <hi>grapes,</hi> which are moſt proper for this <hi>Iſle,</hi> and though there are many ſorts of <hi>grapes</hi> amongſt <hi>Gardiners;</hi> yet I commend 4. ſorts eſpecially to them; and I deſire that they be very careful in this particular: for it is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the worke; if you faile in this, you faile in all; for I know that <hi>Burdeaux-Vines</hi> which beare very great <hi>grapes,</hi> make <hi>verjuice</hi> onely at <hi>Paris,</hi> and that the tender <hi>Orleans-Vine</hi> doth not thrive there.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſort is the <hi>Parſely Vine</hi> or <hi>Canada-grape;</hi> becauſe it firſt came from thoſe parts, where it growes naturally; and though the Countrey be intolerably cold; yet even in the woods without manuring, it ſo farre ripeneth his fruits, that the <hi>Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its</hi> make <hi>wine</hi> of it for their maſſe; &amp; <hi>Racineè</hi> (which is the <hi>Juice</hi> of the <hi>grape</hi> newly expreſt, and boiled to a <hi>Syrupe,</hi> and is very ſweet and pleaſant) for their Lent-proviſion, as you may reade in their <hi>Relations:</hi> and this <hi>Vine</hi> ſeemeth to be made for theſe <hi>Northerne</hi> Countreyes, becauſe it hath it's leaves very ſmall and jaggy, as if it were on purpoſe to let in the ſun, and it ripeneth ſooner than other <hi>grapes,</hi> as I have obſerved in <hi>Oxford-Graden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:114859:21"/> 2. Sort of <hi>Vine</hi> is the <hi>Rheniſh-grape;</hi> for it groweth in a temperate Countrey, not much hotter in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer then <hi>England;</hi> and the <hi>wine</hi> is excellent as all know.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sort is the <hi>Paris-grape;</hi> which is much like the temper of <hi>England,</hi> onely a little hotter in ſummer: this <hi>grape</hi> beareth a ſmall bunch cloſe ſet together, very hardy to endure <hi>frosts</hi> and other <hi>inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> and is ſoone ripe; ſo that the <hi>vintage</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> is ſooner ended then that of <hi>Orleans</hi> or <hi>Burdeaux;</hi> and though it be not ſo delicate to the taſte, as ſome other <hi>grapes;</hi> yet it maketh an excellent brisk <hi>wine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Sort is the <hi>ſmall muskadell;</hi> which is a very fine pleaſant <hi>grape,</hi> both to eat and to make <hi>wine.</hi> In <hi>Italy</hi> it uſually groweth againſt their houſes walls, and of this they make a ſmall pleaſant <hi>wine,</hi> a moneth or 2. before the ordinary <hi>Vintage.</hi> It is a tender plant in reſpect of the other <hi>Vines</hi> in the fields: theſe <hi>Vines</hi> I know are the moſt convenient for this Iſle; becauſe they beare ſmall bunches, and <hi>grapes</hi> ſoon ripen, and are hardy to endure froſts and ill wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>2. To chooſe convenient places. For this end I councell them, Firſt to plant <hi>Vines</hi> on the <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide</hi> of their <hi>dwelling-houſes, Barnes, Stables,</hi> and <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes.</hi> The <hi>Gentleman</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi> whome I mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, uſeth this courſe: and to keepe the <hi>Vines</hi> from hurting his tiles, and that the winde may not wrong his <hi>Vines,</hi> he hath a frame made of poles or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kinde of wood, about a foot from the tiles, to the which he tyeth the <hi>Vines;</hi> by this meanes his <hi>Vines</hi> having the reflection of the yard, ſides of the houſes and tiles, do ripen very well, and beare much; ſo
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:114859:22"/> that one old <hi>Vine,</hi> hath produced nigh a hogshead of <hi>wine</hi> in one year: and I wiſh all to take this courſe; which is neither chargeable, nor troubleſome, but very pleaſant; and if all in this <hi>Iſland</hi> would do thus, it's incredible, what abundance of <hi>wine</hi> might be made, even by this petty way.</p>
               <p>2. If that any <hi>Gentleman</hi> will be at the charge of making a <hi>Vineyard,</hi> let him chooſe a fine ſandy warm hill, open to the <hi>South-Eaſt</hi> rather than to the <hi>South-Weſt:</hi> for though the <hi>South-West</hi> ſeemeth to be hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; yet the <hi>South-East</hi> ripeneth better, as I have ſeen in <hi>Oxford-Garden;</hi> becauſe the <hi>South-Eaſt</hi> is ſooner warmed by the Sun in the morning; and the <hi>South-West</hi> winds, are the winds which blow moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and bring raine, which refrigerate the plants: and ſuch a place is very requiſite; for in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places <hi>Vines</hi> do not thrive, even in <hi>France:</hi> for if you travel betwixt <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Orleans,</hi> which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 30. leagues, yet you ſhall ſcarcely ſee a <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,</hi> becauſe it is a plaine Champion-Countrey. So likewiſe betwixt <hi>Fontarabia</hi> to <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> in the <hi>Southerne</hi> parts of <hi>France,</hi> for an 100. miles together; becauſe the land is generally a barren ſandy plaine, where onely <hi>Heath</hi> abounds and <hi>Pine-trees,</hi> out of which they make <hi>Turpentine</hi> and <hi>Rozen,</hi> by wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them; and <hi>Tarre</hi> and <hi>Pitch,</hi> by the burning of them: and if any finde ſuch a fine warme hill, and do dung and fence it well, he hath a greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of moſt of the <hi>Vineyards</hi> of <hi>France</hi> by this conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency, than they have of our <hi>Iſle,</hi> by being a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles more <hi>South;</hi> for moſt of their <hi>Vineyards</hi> are in large fields not encloſed, on land that is ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and but indifferently warme. But ſome will ſay,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:114859:22"/> that the wet weather deſtroyes us. It's true, that the wet will deſtroy all things; <hi>Sheepe, Corne,</hi> &amp;c. yet no man will ſay, that therefore <hi>England</hi> will not produce and nouriſh theſe Creatures; and if extraordinary wet years come, they ſpoile even the <hi>Vines</hi> in <hi>France:</hi> but take ordinary years and our moiſture is not ſo great, (though ſome abuſe us, and call <hi>England, matula Coeli)</hi> but the <hi>Vines,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe I have mentioned before, will come to ſuch perfection as to make good <hi>wine:</hi> and if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary raines fall; yet we may helpe the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maturity by <hi>Ingenuity,</hi> as I ſhall tell you anon: or at worſt make <hi>vineger</hi> or <hi>verjuice,</hi> which will pay coſts.</p>
               <p>Further theſe advantages we have of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. This <hi>Iſle</hi> is not ſubject to nipping froſts in <hi>May</hi> as <hi>France</hi> is; becauſe we are in an <hi>Iſle,</hi> where the Air is more groſſe than in the <hi>Continent;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not ſo piercing and ſharpe, as it plainly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by our <hi>winters,</hi> which are not ſo ſharpe as in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua</hi> in <hi>Italy:</hi> neither are we ſubject to ſuch ſtormes of <hi>haile</hi> in <hi>ſummer,</hi> which are very frequent in <hi>hot Countreys,</hi> and for many miles together do ſpoile their <hi>Vines,</hi> ſo that they cannot make <hi>wine</hi> of the <hi>grapes:</hi> for thoſe <hi>grapes</hi> which are touched by the <hi>haile,</hi> have a <hi>Sulphurious</hi> and a very unpleaſant taſte, and onely fit to make <hi>Aqua-vitae.</hi> Further ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in <hi>France,</hi> caske for their <hi>wines</hi> is ſo deare, that a <hi>tun</hi> of <hi>wine</hi> may be had for a <hi>tun</hi> of <hi>caske:</hi> and the <hi>custome</hi> and <hi>excize</hi> which is laide on <hi>wines</hi> here, is as much againe as the poore <hi>Vigneron</hi> in <hi>France</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects for his <hi>wine.</hi> Not to ſpeak of the ill managing of their <hi>Vines,</hi> eſpecially about <hi>Paris,</hi> where poor
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:114859:23"/> men uſually hire an Acre or 2. of <hi>Vines,</hi> which they manage at their ſpare houres, and moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly packe in ſo many plants on their ground, for to have the greater increaſe, that the ground and <hi>Vines</hi> are ſo ſhaded by one another, that I have wondered, that the Sun could dart in his beames to mature them; and therefore I cannot but affirme again, that we may make abundance of <hi>wine</hi> here with profit, the charges of an Acre of <hi>Vineyard,</hi> not being ſo great as of <hi>Hops:</hi> an hundred ſets well rooted, at <hi>Paris</hi> coſt uſually but 4. or 6. <hi>ſous</hi> or pence, where I have bought many: 2000. will plant an Acre very well, 50. s. a year is the ordinary rate for the 3. diggings with their <hi>crooked Inſtrument</hi> called <hi>Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,</hi> and the increaſe uſually 4. tuns for an Acre, which will be profit enough: and though I referre all to <hi>Bonovil</hi> and others, who have written of the <hi>managing of Vines;</hi> yet I councell to get a <hi>Vigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> where there are plenty, and at cheaper rates then ordinary ſervants here, and who will be ſerviceable alſo for <hi>Gardening.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. I will briefly tell, what I have ſeen. In <hi>Italy</hi> through all <hi>Lombardy</hi> which is for the moſt part plaine and <hi>Champion,</hi> their <hi>Vines</hi> grow in their <hi>hedges</hi> on <hi>Walnut-trees,</hi> for the moſt part: in which fields, they ſpeake of 3. harveſts yearly <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Winter-Corne,</hi> which is reaped in <hi>June</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Vines</hi> and <hi>Walnuts,</hi> which are gathered in <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Their <hi>ſummer-graines,</hi> as <hi>Millet, Panicle, Chiches, Vetches &amp;c. Buck-wheate, Frumentone,</hi> or that which we call <hi>Virginia-Wheate, Turneps,</hi> which they ſowe in <hi>July</hi> when their <hi>Winter-corne</hi> is cut &amp; reaped, they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:114859:23"/> reape in <hi>October.</hi> In <hi>France,</hi> their <hi>Vines</hi> grow 3. manner of wayes; in <hi>Provence</hi> they cut the <hi>Vine</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 2. foot high, and make it ſtrong and ſtubbed, like as we do our <hi>Oſiers;</hi> which ſtock beareth up the branches without a <hi>prop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. about <hi>Orleans,</hi> and where they are more curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, they make frames for them to run along.</p>
               <p>3. About <hi>Paris</hi> they ty them to ſhort poles, as we do hops. In <hi>France</hi> they uſually make trenches, or ſmall ditches, about 3. or 4. foot from one another, and therein plant their <hi>Vines,</hi> about one and a half deepe, which is a good way, and very much to be commended; but if we here in <hi>England,</hi> plant <hi>Vines</hi> as we do <hi>Hops,</hi> it will do very well, but let them not be packt together too thick, as they do in <hi>France</hi> in many places, leaſt they too much ſhade the ground, and one another. In <hi>Italy</hi> when they tread their grapes with their feet in a cart, they powre the juice into a great veſſel or Fat, and put to it all their husks and ſtones which they call <hi>graſpe,</hi> and let them <hi>ferment,</hi> or (as we ſay) <hi>worke</hi> together 12. or 14. dayes, and uſually they put 1. third of water to it, this maketh a <hi>wine</hi> leſſe furious, <hi>Garbo</hi> or rough, and therefore a good ſtomack-wine; but it ſpoileth the colour, and taketh away the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant brisk taſte. In <hi>France</hi> ſo ſoon as they have preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed out their liquor with their feet, they put it in hogsheads, and after in their preſſe ſqueaſe out what they can, out of the <hi>graſpe;</hi> which ſerveth to fill up their hogsheads while they worke, which is uſually 3. or 4. dayes, and then ſtop them cloſe: this is alſo the way uſed in <hi>Germany,</hi> and is the beſt, for it maketh a fine gentile <hi>wine</hi> with a curious co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:114859:24"/> In <hi>Germany,</hi> when their <hi>grapes</hi> are green, they make fire in their ſellars in ſtoves, by the which meanes, their <hi>wines</hi> worke extraordinarily, &amp; do di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt themſelves the better: This courſe we muſt alſo take here in <hi>England</hi> ſome years; for it helpeth the rawnes of all liquors very much. There is an <hi>Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Dutchman,</hi> who hath a ſecret, which as yet he will not reveale, how to helpe <hi>maturation</hi> by a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt</hi> applyed to the roots: The <hi>compoſt</hi> which I have ſpoken of before, made of <hi>brimſtone: pigeons-dung,</hi> is very <hi>excellent</hi> for that <hi>purpoſe,</hi> as alſo <hi>lees of wine, blood,</hi>

               <p>3. <hi>Fermentation</hi> giveth a <hi>vinous</hi> taſte, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a liquor full of ſpirits.</p>
               <p>You may then eaſily gueſſe at the way, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he may add alſo ſome <hi>ſugar and ſpices,</hi> as the <hi>Vintners</hi> do when they make <hi>Hippocras.</hi> I know a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> who hath made excellent <hi>wine</hi> of <hi>raiſins</hi> well boil'd in water, and afterward fermented by it ſelfe, or with barme, its called uſually <hi>Medea.</hi> I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe know, that all ſweet and fatty <hi>Juices</hi> will make fine <hi>vinous Liquors,</hi> as <hi>Damſins,</hi> if they be wrought or fermented ingeniouſly: but whoſoever goeth about ſuch experiments, let him not think that any thing is good enough for theſe purpoſes: but let him uſe the beſt he can get: for of naughty <hi>corrupt</hi> things,

Acres of land, ſhould ſowe halfe an Acre or an Acre of <hi>Hempe</hi> or <hi>Flax,</hi> or to pay 5. s. or 10. s. to the poore of the Pariſh where they live, or ſome law to this purpoſe; for there is no man but hath land fit for one of theſe, <hi>Hempe</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring, a ſtiffe land, <hi>Flax</hi> that which is light.</p>
               <p>For there is ſo much irrationality in ſome profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that they muſt be forced even like brutes to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand their own good. In <hi>King Edward</hi> the 6. dayes ſomething was enacted to this purpoſe, as I am informed. In <hi>Henry</hi> 8. dayes, there was a law enacted that every man ſhould ſowe his lands, and that no man ſhould encloſe his lands, leaſt he ſhould
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:114859:25"/> turne it to <hi>Paſture;</hi> for we have had great dearth in <hi>England</hi> through the neglect of <hi>Tillage,</hi> which lawes even as yet ſtand in force; yet there is, nor need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth there be any force to compell men to till and ſowe their lands; for they have at length found the ſweetneſſe, and willingly go about it for their own profits ſake, and now we ſuppoſe (and not without cauſe) that <hi>Encloſing</hi> is an <hi>Improvement:</hi> and ſo concerning <hi>Hempe</hi> and <hi>Flaxe,</hi> I ſay, if they were once accuſtomed to ſowe them, they would never leave it, as I ſee <hi>Farmers</hi> do in <hi>Eaſt-Kent;</hi> ſcarce a man but he will have a conſiderable plot of ground for <hi>Hempe,</hi> and about <hi>London</hi> far greater quantities of <hi>Flax</hi> is ſown then formerly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It were convenient, that every Pariſh through the Nation ſhould have a ſtocke for to ſet their poor to worke, that the young children and women might not run up and down idle, and begging or ſtealing (as they do in the <hi>Countrey)</hi> of <hi>Apples, Peaſe, Wood, Hedges,</hi> and ſo by little and little, are train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up for the <hi>Gallowes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That a ſevere law ſhould be enacted againſt thoſe who run up and downe and will not worke: for if all know, that they may have worke at home, and earne more within doores honeſtly, then by running rogueing up and downe, why ſhould they not compell them to it? and though ſome may think the Pariſhes will loſe much by this way; becauſe that the ſtock wrought will not be put off, but with loſſe, as perhaps 10. l. will be brought to 8. l. yet let them conſider how much they ſhall ſave at their doors, how many inconveniences they are freed from; their hedges in the Countrey ſhall not be
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:114859:25"/> pulled, their fruits ſtolne, nor their Corne pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loined; and further, that the poor will be trained up to worke, and therefore fit for any ſervice: yea and in their youth learne a calling by the which they may get an honeſt lively hood; and I dare ſay, their Aſſeſſements for the poor, would not be ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, nor the poor ſo numerous: and the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit which redownds to the <hi>Nation,</hi> would be very great.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The charitable deeds of our fore-fathers, ought to be enquired after, that they be not miſplaced, as uſually they are, but be really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed for the good of the poore, that are labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious (as in <hi>London</hi> is begun) and if there be any that will not worke, take Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> rule, who beſt knew what was beſt for them. I dare not adviſe to take in part of <hi>Commons, Fens,</hi> &amp;c. and to improve them for this uſe, leaſt I ſhould too much provoke the rude mercileſſe multitude. But to returne to my diſcourſe. I ſay, that ſowing <hi>Hempe</hi> and <hi>Flax,</hi> will be very beneficial.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To the Owners of land: for men uſually give in divers places 3. l. <hi>per</hi> Acre, to ſowe <hi>Hempe</hi> and <hi>Flax</hi> (as I have ſeen at <hi>Maidſtone</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> which is the onely place, I know in <hi>England,</hi> where <hi>thread</hi> is made: and though nigh a hundred hands are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about it; yet they make not enough for this <hi>Nation,)</hi> and yet get good profit. How advantageous will this be to thoſe who have drained the <hi>Fens,</hi> where queſtionleſs <hi>Hempe</hi> will flouriſh, and exſiccate the ground, (for <hi>Hempe</hi> deſireth ſtiffe moiſt land, as <hi>Flax</hi> light and dry,) and like wiſe to thoſe in the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> where land is very cheape? I hope
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:114859:26"/> in a little time <hi>Ireland</hi> will furniſh us with theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, if we be idle; for there land is very cheap, and thoſe ſeeds need no incloſure; for cattel will not touch them, neither doth it feare the plunderer either in the field or barne.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It's profitable to the ſower. I know that they uſually value an Acre at 10. or 12. l. which coſteth them uſually but halfe the money. Whether there be <hi>Flax,</hi> that will yield 30. or 40. l. <hi>per</hi> Acre as ſome report, I know not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To the place where it is ſowne; becauſe it ſets many poore to worke. I wiſh it were encouraged more in the <hi>North</hi> than it is; becauſe there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poore, who could willingly take paines: and though <hi>ſpinning of linnen</hi> be but a poor worke; yet it is light, and may be called <hi>Womens recreation,</hi> (and in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> the <hi>beſt Citizens wives</hi> think it no diſgrace to go about <hi>ſpinning</hi> with their <hi>Rocks)</hi> and though in ſome part the poore think it nothing to earne 4. or 6. d. <hi>per</hi> day, and will as ſoon ſtand with their hands in their pockets, as worke cheape; yet in the <hi>North</hi> they account it well to earne 3. d. or 4. d. by <hi>ſpinning,</hi> which they may do.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, it would be very beneficial to this <hi>Nation,</hi> and ſave many thouſand pounds, I may ſay 100. thouſands, which are expected, either in caſh or good Commodities; and we ſhould not be beholding to <hi>Holland</hi> for <hi>fine linnen</hi> and <hi>Cordage,</hi> nor to <hi>France</hi> for <hi>Poldavices, Locrams, Canvaces, nets,</hi> nor to <hi>Flaunders</hi> for <hi>thread;</hi> but might be ſupplyed abundantly with theſe neceſſary Commodities even at our own doors.</p>
               <p>There is no ſmall <hi>Deficiency</hi> in dunging and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuring
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:114859:26"/> lands, both becauſe that all manner of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuring <note place="margin" type="runSum">9. <hi>Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dunging, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuring Lands.</hi>
                  </note> and amending lands, is not known to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, and alſo that they do not imploy all they know to the beſt uſe. I will therefore ſet downe moſt of the wayes I have ſeen here in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>beyond Seas,</hi> by which land is improved, and the beſt wayes to uſe the ſame.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To begin with <hi>Chalke,</hi> which is as old a way as <hi>Julius Ceſars</hi> time, as he himſelfe reporteth in his <hi>Commentaries. Chalke</hi> is of 2. ſorts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A <hi>hard, ſtrong, dry Chalke,</hi> with which in <hi>Kent</hi> they make walls, burn lime &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Kind is a <hi>ſmall unctuous Chalke:</hi> this is the <hi>Chalke</hi> for land, the other helpeth little; onely it maketh the plough go eaſier in ſtiffe lands: broomy land is accounted the beſt land for <hi>Chalke</hi> and <hi>lime,</hi> but it helpeth other lands alſo; eſpecially, if you <hi>Chalke</hi> your ground, and let it ly a year or 2. which is the way uſed in <hi>Kent;</hi> that it may be matured and ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the ſun and raine, otherwiſe if it be turned in preſently, it is apt to ly in great clods, as I have ſeen it 20. years after. <hi>Chalke</hi> alſo ſweetneth <hi>paſture,</hi> but doth not much increaſe it, and killeth <hi>ruſhes</hi> and <hi>broome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Lime,</hi> which is made of divers ſorts of <hi>stones,</hi> is an excellent thing for moſt <hi>Lands,</hi> and produceth a moſt pure graine: 160. buſhels is uſually laid on an Acre, but I ſuppoſe that if men did lay but halfe the dung on the ground, as they uſually do, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>lime</hi> and <hi>Chalke,</hi> and <hi>dung</hi> and <hi>lime</hi> it oftener, it would be better <hi>Husbandry:</hi> for much <hi>dung</hi> cauſeth much <hi>weeds,</hi> and cauſeth <hi>Corn</hi> to lodge; and too much <hi>Chalke</hi> doth too much force the land, ſo that after
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:114859:27"/> ſome good crops, it lyeth barren many yeares. It's good <hi>Husbandry</hi> likewiſe to lay down lands before they be too much out of heart; for they will ſoone recover; otherwiſe not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Ordinary Dung,</hi> which every one knoweth; but let it not be expoſed to the Sun too much, nor let it ly in an high place; for the raine will waſte away it's fatneſſe. It's obſerveable, that earth the more it is expoſed to the Sun, it's the better, as we ſee that land is much bettered by oft ploughings: for the Sun and dew engender a <hi>nitrous</hi> fatneſſe, which is the cauſe of <hi>fertility;</hi> but dung is exhauſted by the Sun, as it appeareth by the <hi>foldings</hi> of <hi>Sheepe,</hi> which profit little, if it be not preſently turned in; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a <hi>Shepherd</hi> if his time would permit, ſhould turne up the ground with an howe for to ſowe <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neps,</hi> as <hi>Gardiners</hi> do. I have ſeen <hi>Ordinary Dung</hi> on dry lands in dry years to do hurt, and it oft cauſeth weeds and trumpery to grow.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Marle.</hi> It's of divers kinds: ſome ſtony, ſome ſoft, ſome white, ſome yellewiſh, but moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blew. It's in moſt places in <hi>England,</hi> but not knowne by all: the beſt markes to know it, is to expoſe it to the Aire, and to ſee if the Sun or Rain cauſe it to ſhatter, and if it be <hi>unctuous,</hi> or rather to take a load or 2. and lay it on the midſt of your fields, and to try how it mendeth your lands. It's excellent for <hi>Corne,</hi> and <hi>Pasture;</hi> eſpecially on dry lands. In <hi>Eſſex</hi> the ſcourings of their ditches they call <hi>Marle,</hi> becauſe it looketh blew like it, it help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their lands well,</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Snaggreet:</hi> which is a kind of earth taken out of the <hi>Rivers,</hi> full of ſmall ſhels. It helpeth the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:114859:27"/> lands in divers parts of <hi>Surrey.</hi> I beleeve it's found in all <hi>Rivers;</hi> It were well, if in other parts of <hi>England,</hi> they did take notice of it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Owſe</hi> out of marſh ditches, hath been found very good for white <hi>Chalky</hi> land: as alſo <hi>Sea-mud</hi> &amp; <hi>Sea-Owſe</hi> is uſed in divers parts of <hi>Kent,</hi> and <hi>Suſſex.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Sea-weeds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Mr. <hi>Carew</hi> in his <hi>Survey</hi> of <hi>Cornwall</hi> relateth, that they uſe a fat <hi>Sea-ſand,</hi> which they carry up many miles in ſacks, and by this they have very much improved their barren lands. It were worth the while to try all manner of <hi>Sea-ſands:</hi> for I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that in other places they have a like <hi>fertilizing</hi> fatneſſe.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Folding</hi> of <hi>Sheepe,</hi> eſpecially after the <hi>Flaunders</hi> manner, <hi>(viz.)</hi> under a covert, in which earth is ſtrewed about 6. inches thick, on which they ſet divers nights: then more earth muſt be brought and ſtrewed 6. inches thick, and the <hi>Sheepe folded</hi> on it, and thus they do continually <hi>Winter</hi> and <hi>Summer.</hi> I ſuppoſe a ſhepherd, with one horſe will do it at his ſpare houres, and indeed ſooner then remove his <hi>fold;</hi> and this <hi>folding</hi> is to be continued, eſpecially in <hi>Winter,</hi> and doth the <hi>Sheepe</hi> good; becauſe they ly warme and dry: and truly if I am not miſtaken, by this meanes we may make our <hi>Sheepe</hi> to enrich all the barren dry lands of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Aſhes</hi> of any kind. <hi>Seacoale-aſhes</hi> with <hi>horſedung</hi> the Gardiners of <hi>London</hi> much commend for divers uſes. It's great pitty, that ſo many thouſand loads are throwne into waſte places, and do no good.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>Soote</hi> is alſo very good, being ſprinkled on <hi>ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but it's too deer, if it be of <hi>wood;</hi> for it's worth 16. d. or 2. s. a buſhel.</p>
               <p n="12">
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:114859:28"/> 12. <hi>Pigeons</hi> or <hi>Hens-dung</hi> is incomparable: one load is worth 10. loads of other <hi>dung,</hi> &amp; therefore it's uſually ſowne on <hi>Wheate,</hi> that lyeth a far off, and not eaſy to be helped: it's extraordinary likewiſe on a <hi>Hop-garden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>Malt-duſt</hi> is exceedingly good in <hi>Corne-land: blood</hi> for <hi>trees;</hi> alſo <hi>ſhavings of hornes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. Some commend very much the <hi>ſweeping</hi> of a <hi>Ship</hi> of <hi>Salt,</hi> or <hi>droſſey ſalt</hi> and <hi>brine:</hi> it's very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable; becauſe it killeth the wormes, and all <hi>fertility</hi> proceedeth from <hi>ſalt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. I have ſeen in <hi>France,</hi> poore men cut up <hi>Heath</hi> and the <hi>Turffe</hi> of the ground, and lay them on an heape, to make <hi>mould</hi> for their barren lands. <hi>Brakes</hi> laid in a moiſt place, and rotted, are uſed much for <hi>Hop-grounds,</hi> and generally all things that will rot, if they were ſtones, would make <hi>dung.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. In <hi>New-England</hi> they <hi>fiſh</hi> their ground, which is done thus: In the <hi>ſpring</hi> about <hi>April,</hi> there cometh up a <hi>fiſh</hi> to the freſh <hi>Rivers,</hi> called an <hi>Alewife;</hi> becauſe of it's great belly: and is a kind of <hi>ſhade,</hi> full of bones; theſe are caught in wiers, and ſold very cheape to the planters, who uſually put one or two cut in peeces into the hill where their Corne is planted, called <hi>Virginia-Wheate,</hi> for they plant it in hills, 5. graines in an hill, almoſt as we plant <hi>Hops</hi> (in <hi>May,</hi> or <hi>June;</hi> for it will not endure froſts) and at that diſtance; it cauſeth fertility extraodinary for two years, eſpecially the firſt: for they have had 50. or 60. buſhels on an Acre, and yet plough not their land, and in the ſame hills do plant the ſame Corne for many years together, and have good crops: beſides abundance of <hi>Pumpions</hi> and

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:114859:30"/> Acre is not comperable to it, <hi>Farteſcue Chancelor</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> ſaith, that we get more in <hi>England</hi> by ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill then the <hi>French</hi> by working: but to ſpeak of the <hi>Deficiencies</hi> amongſt us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We are to blame, that we have neglected the great <hi>Clover-graſſe, Saint Foine, Lucerne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That we do not float our lands, as they do in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> where they mowe their lands 3. or 4. times yearly, which conſiſt of the great <hi>Clover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graſſe.</hi> Here are the excellent <hi>Parmiſane-cheeſes</hi> made, and indeed theſe <hi>Paſtures</hi> far exceed any other places in <hi>Italy,</hi> yea in <hi>Europe.</hi> We here in <hi>England</hi> have great opportunities by brooks &amp; Rivers in all places to do ſo, but we are <hi>negligent;</hi> yet we might hereby double if not trebble our profits, kill all ruſhes &amp;c. But he that deſireth to know the manner how to do this, and that profit, that will ariſe thereby, let him reade Mr. <hi>Blithes</hi> Booke of <hi>Husbandry,</hi> lately print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That when we lay down land for <hi>Meadow</hi> or <hi>Pasture,</hi> we do not ſowe them with the ſeeds of fine ſweet graſſe, <hi>Trefoiles,</hi> and other excellent <hi>herbes.</hi> Concerning this you may reade a large <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of the <hi>Countrey-Farmer;</hi> for if the land be rich, it will put forth <hi>weeds</hi> and trumpery, and perhaps a kind of ſoure graſſe little worth, if it be poore, ye ſhall have thiſtles, <hi>May-weed</hi> and little or no graſſe, for a yeare or 2. I know a Gentleman, who at my entreaty, ſowed with his <hi>Oates</hi> the bottome of his <hi>Hay-mowe,</hi> and though his land were worne out of heart, and naturally poore; yet he had that year not onely a crop of <hi>Oates;</hi> but he might if it had pleaſed him, have mowen his graſſe alſo, but
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:114859:30"/> he ſpared it, which was well done, till the next year, that it might make a <hi>turffe</hi> and grow ſtronger. By this <hi>Husbandry</hi> lands might be well improved, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if men did conſider the diverſity of graſſes, which are 90. ſorts, and 23. of <hi>Trefoile:</hi> I know a place in <hi>Kent,</hi> which is a white <hi>Chalky downe,</hi> which ground is ſometimes ſowen with Corne a year or 2. and then it reſteth as long or longer: when it is laid down it maintaineth many great <hi>Sheepe</hi> and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry luſty, ſo that they are even fit for the <hi>Butcher;</hi> and yet there doth ſcarce appeare any thing that they can eate, which bath cauſed divers to wonder, as if they had lived on <hi>Chalke-ſtones:</hi> but I more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſidering the matter, throughly viewed the ground, and perceived that the ground natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally produceth a ſmall <hi>Trefoile,</hi> which it ſeemeth is very ſweet and pleaſant, it's commonly called <hi>Trifolium luteum,</hi> or <hi>Lupilinum,</hi> that is, <hi>yellow</hi> or <hi>Hop-Trefoile:</hi> and I am perſwaded, if that the ſeed of this <hi>Trefoile</hi> were preſerved, and ſowen with <hi>dates,</hi> when they intend to lay it downe, it would very much advance the <hi>Paſture</hi> of that place; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I deſire all <hi>Ingenious</hi> men, ſeriouſly to conſider, the nature of the <hi>Trefoiles,</hi> which are the ſweeteſt of graſſes, and to obſerve on what grounds they natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally grow: and alſo the nature of other graſſes, which (as I have ſaid before) are no leſſe then 90. ſorts, naturally growing in this Iſle; ſome on wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try places, ſome on dry, ſome on clay, others on ſand, Chalk &amp;c. ſome on fruitful places, others in barren; by the which meanes I ſuppoſe a ſolid foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation might be laid, for the advancing the <hi>Paſture-lands</hi> of all ſorts, through this <hi>Iſland:</hi> for I know
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:114859:31"/> ſome plants, as the <hi>Orchis</hi> call'd <hi>Bee-flower</hi> &amp;c. which will thrive better on the <hi>Chalky</hi> barren bankes, than in any garden, though the mould be never ſo rich and delicate, and the Gardiner very diligent in cheriſhing of it: and why may not the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety be in graſſes? for we ſee diverſe <hi>benty</hi> graſſes to thrive, eſpecially on barren places, where ſcarce any thing elſe will grow. J muſt againe and againe deſire all men to take notice of the wonderful graſſe which groweth neare <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and deſire them to try it on their Rich <hi>Meadowes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It's a common ſaying, that there are more <hi>waste</hi> lands in <hi>England,</hi> in theſe particulars, than in all <note place="margin" type="runSum">11. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing waſte Lands.</hi>

                  <hi>Europe</hi> beſides, conſidering the quantity of land. I dare not ſay this is true; but hope if it be ſo, that it will be mended. For of late much hath been done for the advancement of theſe kinds of land; yet there are as yet great <hi>Deſiciencies.</hi> In the times of <hi>Papiſtry,</hi> all in this <hi>Iſland</hi> were either <hi>Souldiers</hi> or <hi>Scholars; Scholars,</hi> by reaſon of the great honours, priviledges, and profits, (the third part of the <hi>Kingdome</hi> belonging to them) and <hi>Souldiers,</hi> becauſe of the many and great warres with <hi>France, Scotland, Ireland, Wales.</hi> And in thoſe times <hi>Gentlemen</hi> thought it an honour to be careleſſe, and to have <hi>houſes, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, diet, exerciſes, apparell,</hi> &amp;c. yea all things at home and abroad, <hi>Souldier-like: Muſick, Pictures, Perfumes, Sauces</hi> (unleſſe good ſtomacks) were counted, perhaps unjuſtly, too effeminate. In <hi>Qu. Elizabeth's</hi> dayes <hi>Ingenuities, Curioſities,</hi> and <hi>Good Husbandry</hi> began to take place, and then <hi>Salt Marſhes</hi> began to be fenced from the Seas; and yet many were neglected, even to our dayes, as <hi>Hollhaven</hi> in

                  <hi>Eſſex, Axtel-holme Iſle</hi> in York-ſhire: many 1000. of Acres have lately been gained from the Sea in <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colne-ſhire,</hi> and as yet more are to be taken in there, and in other places. <hi>Rumſey-marſh</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of 45000. Acres and upwards, (as <hi>Cambden</hi> relateth) is of ſome antiquity, where the land is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally let for 30. s. <hi>per</hi> Acre, and yet 1. d. <hi>per</hi> week con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly is pay'd, through the whole levil, for the maintenance of the wall, and now and then 2. d. whereas ordinary ſalts are accounted dear at 5. s. or 6. s. <hi>per</hi> Acre; ſo that the improvement is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable: the ſame I may ſay of <hi>Fens,</hi> eſpecially that great <hi>Fen</hi> of <hi>Lincolne-ſhire, Cambridge, Hungting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> conſiſting as I am Informed of 380000. Acres, which is now almoſt recovered; and a friend of mine told me very lately, that he had proffered a marke <hi>per</hi> Acre; for 900. Acres together, to ſowe <hi>Rape</hi> on, which formerly was ſcarcely valued at 12. d. <hi>per</hi> Acre; very great therefore is the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of draining of lands, and our negligence very great, that they have been waſte ſo long, and as yet ſo continue in divers places: for the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of a Kingdome is better than the conquering a new one.</p>
               <p>2. I ſee likewiſe no ſmall faults in this land, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo many <hi>Chaſes</hi> and <hi>Forreſts,</hi> where <hi>brambles, brakes, furzes</hi> do grow, when as theſe trumperies might be cut up, and pot-aſhes made of them; and the ground imployed profitably for <hi>Corne,</hi> or <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture.</hi> I know a <hi>Forreſt</hi> by <hi>Brill</hi> in <hi>Buckingham-ſhire</hi> taken in, and the land is uſually let being now well encloſed, for 4. or 5.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:114859:32"/> know that poore people will cry out againſt me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I call theſe <hi>waſte-lands;</hi> but its no matter: I deſire Ingenious <hi>Gentlemen</hi> ſeriouſly to conſider, whether or no theſe lands might not be improved very much by the <hi>Husbandry</hi> of <hi>Flaunders, (viz.)</hi> by ſowing <hi>Flax, Turneps,</hi> great <hi>Clover-Graſſe,</hi> if that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure</hi> be made by <hi>folding Sbeepe</hi> after the <hi>Flaunders</hi> way, to keepe it in heart?</p>
               <p>2. Whether the <hi>Rottenneſſe</hi> and <hi>Scabbineſſe</hi> of <hi>Sheepe, Murrein</hi> of Cattel, <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> of horſes, and in general all diſeaſes of Cattel do not eſpecially proceed from <hi>Commons?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. If the rich men, who are able to keepe great ſtockes, are not great gainers by them?</p>
               <p>4. Whether <hi>Commons</hi> do not rather make poore, by cauſing idleneſſe, than maintaine them; and ſuch poor, who are trained up rather for the Gallowes or beggery, than for the Common-wealths ſervice?</p>
               <p>5. How it cometh to paſſe, that there are feweſt poore, where there are feweſt <hi>Commons,</hi> as in <hi>Kent,</hi> where there is ſcarce 6. <hi>Commons</hi> in the <hi>County</hi> of a conſiderable greatneſſe?</p>
               <p>6. How many do they ſee enriched by the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;</hi> &amp; if their Cattel be not uſually ſwept away by the <hi>Rot,</hi> or ſtarved in ſome hard winters?</p>
               <p>7. If that poore men might not imploy 2. Acres encloſed to more advantage; than twice as much in a <hi>Common?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Laſtly, if that all <hi>Commons</hi> were <hi>encloſed,</hi> and part given to the Inhabitants, and part rented out, for a ſtock to ſet all the poore on worke in every <hi>County;</hi> I determine nothing in this kind: but leave the determination for wiſer heads.</p>

               <p> 4. <hi>Parkes.</hi> Although I cannot but reckon <hi>Parks</hi> amongſt lands, which are not <hi>Improved</hi> to the full; but perceive conſiderable <hi>waſte</hi> by them, by <hi>brakes, buſhes, brambles</hi> &amp;c. growing in divers places, and therefore wiſh there were fewer in this <hi>Iſland;</hi> yet I am not ſo great an enemy to them, as moſt are: for there are very great Uſes of them, as.</p>

               <p n="2">2. For the maintaining of Timber, ſo that if any have occaſion, to uſe a good peece of Timber either for a Mill-poſt, or a Keele of a Ship, or other ſpecial uſes, whither can they go but to a <hi>Parke?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3.

But ſome will object, that the plough never goeth there. To the which I anſwer, Its no matter: for I cannot but <note place="margin" type="runSum">Preem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh laws.</note> ſay as <hi>Forteſcue</hi> Chancellor to <hi>Henry</hi> 6. doth, That God hath given us, ſuch a fruitful land, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out labour we have plenty; whereas <hi>France</hi> muſt digge and delve for what they have. And I ſuppoſe, that I could maintaine 2. things which are thought great <hi>Paradoxes, (viz.)</hi> that it were no loſſe to this <hi>Iſland,</hi> if that we ſhould not plough at all, if ſo be that we could certainly have Corne at a reaſonable rate, and likewiſe vent for all our <hi>Manufactures</hi> of <hi>Wooll.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe that the Commodities from Cattel, are far more ſtable than Corne: for, <hi>Cloth, Stuffes, Stoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, Butter, Cheeſe, Hides, Shoes, Tallow,</hi> are certain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven every where: Corne ſcarcely in any place, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in none.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Pasture</hi> imployeth more hands, which is the ſecond <hi>Paradox;</hi> and therefore <hi>Paſture</hi> doth not <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populate,</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:114859:33"/> as it is commonly ſaid: for <hi>Normandy</hi> and <hi>Picardy</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where there are <hi>Paſtures</hi> in a good meaſure, are as populous as any part of <hi>France;</hi> and I am certaine that <hi>Holland, Frizeland, Zealand, Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Lombardy,</hi> which rely altogether on <hi>Paſtures</hi> are the moſt populous places in <hi>Europe.</hi> But ſome will object and ſay, that a ſhepherd and a dog for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly hath deſtroyed divers villages. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that we well know what a ſhepherd and a dog can do, <hi>(viz.)</hi> looke to two or 300. ſheepe at the moſt, and that 2. or 300. Acres will maintaine them, or the land is extreamly barren; and that theſe 2. or 300. Acres being barren, will ſcarcely maintaine a plough (which is but one man and 2. boyes,) with the horſes: and that the <hi>mowing, reaping,</hi> and <hi>threſhing</hi> of this Corne, and other worke about, will ſcarcely maintaine 3. more with worke through the whole yeare. But how many people may be imployed, by the <hi>Wooll</hi> of 2. or 300. <hi>Sheepe,</hi> in <hi>Picking, Sorting, Carding, Spinning, Weaving, Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Fulling, Knitting,</hi> I leave to others to calculate. And further, if the <hi>Paſtures</hi> be rich <hi>Meadowes,</hi> and go on <hi>dairing,</hi> I ſuppoſe all know, that 100. Acres of ſuch land imployeth more hands than 100. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres of the beſt Corne-Land in <hi>England,</hi> and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth likewiſe better <hi>exportable</hi> Commodities. And further, if I ſhould grant, that formerly the ſhepherd and his dog did <hi>depopulate;</hi> yet I will deny, that it doth ſo now: for formerly we were ſo unwiſe, as to ſend over our <hi>Wooll</hi> to <hi>Antwerpe</hi> and other places, where they were <hi>Manufactured;</hi> by which meanes 1. pound oft brought 10. <hi>unwrought</hi> to them; but we ſet now our own poore to work, and ſo ſave the <hi>depopulation.</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:114859:33"/> Yet I ſay, it's convenient to encourage the plough; becauſe that we cannot have a certainty of Corne, and carriage is dear, both by ſea and land, eſpecially into the Inland-Countreyes; and our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities by <hi>Wooll</hi> do cloy the Merchants.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Ruſhy</hi> lands. <hi>Blith</hi> telleth us, good Remedies for theſe <hi>Inconveniencies, (viz.) making deep-trenches, oft mowings, Chalking, Liming, Dunging, Ploughing.</hi> I know where hungry gueſts Horſes ſoone make an end of them.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Furze, broome, heath,</hi> theſe can hardly be ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, but at length they will up againe; for God hath given a peculiar propriety to every kinde of earth, to produce ſome peculiar kinds of Plants, which it will obſerve even to the worlds end, unles by <hi>Dung, Marle, Chalke,</hi> you alter even the very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the earth. In <hi>Gallitia</hi> in <hi>Spine,</hi> where ſuch barren lands do very much abound, they do thus: firſt they grub them up as cleane as they can; of the greater Rootes and branches they make fire-wood; the ſmaller ſtickes are either imployed in fencing, or elſe are burnt on the ground; afterwards the land being ploughed twice at leaſt, they ſowe <hi>Wheat,</hi> and uſually the crop is great, which the <hi>Landlord</hi> and <hi>Tenant</hi> devide according to a compact; then the ground reſteth, and in 3. or 4. years, the <hi>Furze</hi> or <hi>broome</hi> will recover their former growth, which the paineful <hi>Husband-man</hi> grubbeth, and doeth with it as formerly. I ſet this downe that you may ſee how laborious the <hi>Spaniard</hi> is in ſome places, the poverty of the countrey compelling him to it.</p>
               <p>7. There are other <hi>Inconveniencies</hi> in land, beſides weeds and trumpery (viz.) <hi>Ill tenures,</hi> as <hi>coppy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:114859:34"/> 
                  <hi>Knight-ſervice,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that the <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> cannot cut any Timber downe, without conſent of the <hi>Lord;</hi> &amp; when he dyes muſt pay one or 2. years rent. But theſe are not in the power of the poor <hi>Husband-man</hi> to remedy; I therefore paſſe them by: yet hope that in little time, we ſhall ſee theſe <hi>Inconveniencies remedied;</hi> becauſe they much <hi>diſcourage Improvements</hi> and are (as I ſuppoſe) <hi>badges</hi> of our <hi>Norman</hi> ſlavery.</p>
               <p>To conclude, it ſeemeth to me very reaſonable, and it will be a great encouragement to laborious men, to <hi>improve</hi> their barren lands, if that they ſhould have recompence for what they have done, according as indifferent men ſhould judge, when they leave it, as is the cuſtome in <hi>Flaunders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have likewiſe obſerved ſome <hi>Deficiencies</hi> in <hi>Woods,</hi> which I ſhall briefly declare, with the beſt <note place="margin" type="runSum">12. <hi>Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, in Woods.</hi>
                  </note> way to <hi>Remedy</hi> the ſame.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It's a great, <hi>fault</hi> that <hi>generally</hi> through the <hi>Iſland</hi> the <hi>Woods</hi> are deſtroyed; ſo that we are in many places very much neceſſitated both for fuel, &amp; alſo for timber for building and other uſes; ſo that if we had not <hi>Coales</hi> from <hi>New-caſtle,</hi> and <hi>Boards</hi> from <hi>Norwey, Plough-ſtaves</hi> &amp; <hi>pipe-staves</hi> from <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> we ſhould be brought to great extreamity: and many <hi>Mechanickes</hi> would be neceſſitated to leave their callings.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Deficiency,</hi> is that our <hi>Woods</hi> are not ordered as they ſhould be; but though <hi>Woods</hi> are eſpecially preſerved for timber, for building and Shipping; yet at this time it's very rare to ſee a good <hi>Timber-tree</hi> in a <hi>Wood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That many of our <hi>Woods,</hi> are very thinne, and not repleniſhed with ſuch ſorts of <hi>Wood,</hi> as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the place.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:114859:34"/> 4. That we fell continually, and never plant or take care for poſterity.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Deficiencies</hi> may be thus <hi>Remedyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. To put in execution the <hi>Statutes</hi> againſt <hi>grubbing of Woods,</hi> which are ſufficiently ſevere. It's well knowne, we have good lawes; but it's better knowne, they are not executed. In the <hi>Wilde</hi> of <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Suſſex,</hi> which lies far from the <hi>Rivers</hi> and <hi>Sea,</hi> and formerly have been nothing but <hi>Woods,</hi> liberty is granted for men to grub what they pleaſe; for they cannot want firing for themſelves, and they are ſo ſeated, that neither firewood, nor timber can be tranſported elſewhere. I know a <hi>Gentleman</hi> who proffered there good <hi>Oake-timber</hi> at 6. s. 8. d. <hi>per</hi> tun, and the land in thoſe parts in general is very good. About <hi>Tunbridge</hi> there is land which formerly was <hi>Wood,</hi> is now let for 30. <hi>s. per</hi> Acre; ſo that to keepe ſuch lands for <hi>Wood,</hi> would be both loſſe to the <hi>owner</hi> and to the <hi>Iſland:</hi> But in other parts of the <hi>Iſland</hi> it is otherwiſe, and men are much to be blamed for deſtroying both timber and fuel. I have ſeen at <hi>Shooters-hill</hi> near <hi>London,</hi> ſome <hi>Woods</hi> ſtubbed up which were good ground for <hi>Wood,</hi> but now are nothing but <hi>furze,</hi> which is a great loſſe, both to the <hi>owner</hi> and to the <hi>Countrey:</hi> For the land is made worſe then it was formerly. I conceive there are lands, which are as naturally ordained for <hi>Woods, viz. Mountainous, Craggy, uneven land,</hi> as <hi>ſmall hills</hi> for the <hi>Vines</hi> and <hi>Olives; plaine lands</hi> for <hi>Corne;</hi> and <hi>low moist lands</hi> for <hi>Paſture:</hi> which lands if they be ſtubbed, do much prejudice the <hi>Common-wealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That all <hi>Woods</hi> ſhould have ſuch a Number of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:114859:35"/> Timber-trees <hi>per</hi> Acre, according to the <hi>Statute.</hi> There is a good law for that purpoſe, but men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude both themſelves and the law, that they every <hi>felling</hi> cut downe the <hi>ſtanders</hi> which they left the <hi>fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> before, leaſt perchance they ſhould grow to be <hi>Timber,</hi> and leave 12. ſmall <hi>ſtanders,</hi> that they might ſeeme to fulfill in ſome meaſure the <hi>Statute;</hi> but it's a meere fallacy, and cauſeth the <hi>Statute</hi> to faile of it's principal end, which is to preſerve <hi>Timber.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. The beſt <hi>Remedy</hi> againſt thinneſſe of <hi>woods,</hi> is to plaſh them and ſpread them abroad, and cover them partly in the ground, as every <hi>Countreyman</hi> can direct; by this meanes the <hi>wood</hi> will ſoone grow rough and thick. It's good <hi>Husbandry</hi> likewiſe to fill your <hi>woods</hi> with <hi>ſwift growers,</hi> as <hi>Aſhes, Sallow, Willow, Aſpe,</hi> which are alſo good for <hi>Hop-poles, Hoopes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sycamore</hi> is alſo a <hi>ſwift grower.</hi> In <hi>Flaunders,</hi> they have a kinde of <hi>Salix,</hi> called by them <hi>Abell-tree,</hi> which ſpeedily groweth to be timber.</p>

I know one, who was bound by his <hi>Land-Lord</hi> to plant ſo many trees yearly, which according he did, but alwayes in ſuch places that they might not grow.

               <p>2. Our <hi>Honey</hi> is the beſt in the world, and <hi>Wax</hi> a ſtaple Commodity. Further we know, that cold <hi>Countreyes,</hi> not comparable to ours as <hi>Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covia,</hi> have farre greater quantity than we have; ſo that it's incredible what quantity is found in the <hi>Woods,</hi> if <hi>the ſtory of the man</hi> be true, who fell up even to the eares in <hi>Honey,</hi> and had there periſhed, had not a <hi>Beare,</hi> on which he caught hold, pulled him out.

               </p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:114859:37"/>
               <p> 2. We are <hi>Deficient</hi> in the ordering of them. Not to ſpeake of the negligence of particular men, which is very frequent: nor to write a general ſtory of the ordering of them; becauſe it requireth much paper: and Mr. <hi>Leveret</hi> and <hi>Butler;</hi> eſpecially the latter, hath written ſo exactly, and upon his owne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that little can be added to it: onely in a point or 2. I differ from him; of the which I will ſpeak briefly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we muſt take and deſtroy all the <hi>Bees</hi> for their <hi>Honey,</hi> and not drive them, as they do in <hi>Italy</hi> once or twice yearly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That if a <hi>ſwarme</hi> be poore, with little <hi>Honey,</hi> that that <hi>ſwarme</hi> ought to be taken; becauſe it is poore; ſo that the rich ſtockes are deſtroyed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they be rich, and the poore ſwarmes, becauſe they be poore: ſo that be they rich, or be the poore, they muſt be deſtroyed. An <hi>Italian</hi> reporteth, that in the City of <hi>Askaly,</hi> there was a law made, that none ſhould deſtroy a <hi>ſwarme</hi> of <hi>Bees,</hi> unleſſe he had a juſt cauſe; accounting it a part of extreame inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and cruelty, to take away without cauſe, both the goods and lives of ſuch good and faithful ſervants. I am credibly informed, that an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman beyond the Seas, getteth many 100. l. yearly, by keeping <hi>Bees</hi> after a new and Ingenious Manner, which is thus. He hath a roome made very warme and cloſe; yet with glaſſe-windowes, which he can open at his pleaſure, to let the <hi>Bees</hi> fly abroad when he pleaſeth, where he keepeth his <hi>Bees,</hi> and feedeth them all winter with a <hi>ſweete com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi> made of <hi>Moleſſoes, Flowers, ſweete Wine, Milke, Raiſins,</hi> &amp;c. (for with ſuch things as theſe, they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:114859:37"/> feed the <hi>Bees</hi> in <hi>Italy)</hi> and oftentimes in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, when the weather is rainy, windy, or ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that the <hi>Bees</hi> cannot conveniently go abroad, he feedeth them at home, with divers ſweet things, and gathereth divers flowers, and layeth them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and ſticketh up many freſh boughes in divers places of his Roomes, that in <hi>ſwarming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,</hi> they may ſettle on them; by theſe meanes he preſerveth all his ſwarmes, and gathereth an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble quantity of <hi>Honey</hi> and <hi>wax;</hi> and truly this way ſeemeth to me very probable: for</p>
               <p n="1">1. We know the <hi>Bees,</hi> (even as we ſay of the <hi>Aunts)</hi> will worke continually, even night and day; winter and ſummer, if that they were not hindred by darkeneſſe, cold, and moiſture.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>Bees</hi> do not onely make <hi>Honey,</hi> (for I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that they have a peculiar propriety of making <hi>Honey,</hi> as the <hi>Silk-wormes Silk)</hi> out of <hi>Mildewes</hi> or <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> but alſo out of all ſweet things, as <hi>Sugar, Molo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſoes</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That many ſweet things may be had, far cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than <hi>Honey;</hi> which (I ſuppoſe) the <hi>Bees</hi> will tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mute into perfect <hi>Honey.</hi> This way, I conceive, would be very advantageous to us in <hi>England,</hi> for the preſerving of <hi>late ſwarmes,</hi> and alſo for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching of <hi>old stocks,</hi> ſo that we need not deſtroy them, but might drive them from <hi>hive</hi> to <hi>hive,</hi> and ſet them to worke againe; and truly I think there is no place in the world ſo convenient for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe as <hi>England;</hi> becauſe that though our Winters be long, yet they are not very cold; but <hi>Bees</hi> would be ſtirring in them: and further our Summers are ſo ſubject to winds and raines, that many times
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:114859:38"/> there is ſcarce a fine day in a whole weeke: and Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Moloſſoes, Refuſe Sugar, Sweete Wort, Milke,</hi> &amp;c. may be had at reaſonable rates.</p>
               <p>I hope ere long to give an exact account of this experiment, and deſire thoſe who have any Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuities in this kind, freely to communicate them. I have not obſerved many things more of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance concerning <hi>Bees,</hi> in my travels; onely in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> they make their <hi>hives</hi> of <hi>thinne boards,</hi> ſquare, in 2. or 3. partitions, ſtanding either above one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, or very cloſe ſide to ſide, by the which meanes, they can the better borrow part of their <hi>honey</hi> when they pleaſe. In <hi>Germany</hi> their <hi>hives</hi> are made of ſtraw, to the which they have a ſummer-doore, as they call it, which is nigh the top of the <hi>Hive,</hi> that the <hi>Bees</hi> when they are laden, may the more eaſily enter and diſcharge themſelves of their burthens.</p>
               <p>3. We are to blame, that we do not imploy our <hi>Honeys</hi> in making <hi>Metheglim:</hi> It's true that in <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford-ſhire</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> there is ſome quantity of this liquor made; but for want of good cookery it's of little worth; but uſually of a browne colour, of an unpleaſant taſte: and as I ſuppoſe commonly made of the <hi>refuſe honey, wax, dead Bees,</hi> and ſuch ſtuffe, as they ordinarily make it elſewhere: for the good houſe-wife thinkes any thing good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for this purpoſe; and that it is pitty to ſpoyle good <hi>Honey</hi> by making <hi>Meade:</hi> but I know that if one take <hi>pure neate honey,</hi> and ingeniouſly cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify and ſcum and boile it, a liquor may be made not inferiour to the beſt <hi>Sack, Muskadine,</hi> &amp;c. in colour like to <hi>rock-water,</hi> without ill odour or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; ſo that ſome curious Pallates have called it
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:114859:38"/> 
                  <hi>Vin Greco, rich and racy Canary,</hi> not knowing what name to give it, for its excellency: This would bring very great <hi>Profit,</hi> not onely to the <hi>Publique</hi> by ſaving many 1000. l. disburſed for <hi>Wines</hi> through all the world, but would be very advantageous to private families, who uſe to entertaine their friends very Nobly, <hi>Wines</hi> being at preſent intolerably dear and naught; I hope therefore ere long to ſee it put in execution. An excellent drinke not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like this may be made of <hi>Sugar, Moloſſoes, Raiſins</hi> &amp;c. of the which I have already ſpoken, yet think it fit to put you in minde of it againe.</p>
               <p>It's a great <hi>Deficiency</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> that we do <note place="margin" type="runSum">14. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Silk-wormes.</hi>
                  </note> not keepe <hi>Silke-wormes</hi> (which in <hi>Italy</hi> are called <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valieri,)</hi> for to make <hi>Silke.</hi> I know that is a great <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox</hi> to many, but I hope by this ſhort diſcourſe to make this truth to appeare plainly: The firſt ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of <hi>Silke-wormes,</hi> by what I reade in Hiſtories, is from <hi>Perſia,</hi> where in infinite numbers they are ſtill <hi>maintained;</hi> &amp; the <hi>greateſt profits</hi> of that great <hi>Monarch</hi> do ariſe from hence: <hi>China</hi> alſo aboundeth very <hi>much</hi> with <hi>Silke.</hi> In <hi>Virginia</hi> alſo the <hi>Silke-wormes</hi> are found wild amongſt the <hi>Mulberry-woods,</hi> &amp; perhaps might be managed with great profit in thoſe plantations if <hi>Land</hi> were not ſo ſcarce and deare. I ſuppoſe this <hi>Silke-worme</hi> of <hi>Virginia</hi> is produced by the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Mulberry-tree,</hi> as <hi>Cochinneale,</hi> from <hi>ficus In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dica</hi> or <hi>Indian figiree:</hi> for ſome Ingenious and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men who have ſtrictly obſerved the generation of <hi>Inſects,</hi> do finde that every plant hath an <hi>Inſect</hi> which groweth out of its corruption, (as divers ſorts of lice from <hi>Animals,</hi> and that theſe <hi>Inſects</hi> do uſually feed on that plant, out of which they were
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:114859:39"/> made, as <hi>Lice</hi> on the ſame <hi>Animals</hi> from whence they were engendred. I know a Gentleman here in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> who hath 3. or 400. <hi>Inſects,</hi> and can give a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">Mr. Marſhal.</note> good account of their original feedings. And alſo Mr. <hi>Moriney</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> hath a large book of the ſame ſubject. But to returne to our purpoſe: I ſay that we had <hi>Silke-wormes</hi> firſt from <hi>Perſia.</hi> In <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinian's</hi> time about 1000. or 1100. years ago, ſome Monkes preſented a few to him at <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> where in his time they began to plant <hi>Mulber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:</hi> from thence it came to <hi>Italy,</hi> about 3. or 400. years ſince: for the <hi>Auncient Writers</hi> of <hi>Husbandry,</hi> as <hi>Cato, Pallad, Columell,</hi> do not ſo much as mention theſe creatures: and at length theſe have paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Mountains into <hi>France</hi> within an 100. years; where they flouriſh ſo much, that if we will beleeve their own <hi>Authors,</hi> they bring greater profit than the <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Corne</hi> of that large <hi>Countrey.</hi> I know that <hi>France</hi> hath <hi>Silke</hi> enough to maintaine their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of apparell, and to export <hi>Pluſhes, Velvets,</hi> &amp;c. Now then if that theſe wormes can thrive, not onely in the parched <hi>Perſia;</hi> but alſo in <hi>Greece, Italy,</hi> yea in <hi>France;</hi> which differeth not much from the temper of <hi>England;</hi> why ſhould we think, that they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to that place, &amp; muſt move no farther North-ward? for they have come many 100. miles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the <hi>North,</hi> why not one 100. or 2. more? &amp; fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſee that <hi>Mulberries,</hi> which is their food, thrive here as well as in anyplace. But ſome will object that our Aire is too cold and moiſt. To which I anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That thoſe who write of <hi>Silk-wormes,</hi> ſay, that you muſt take heed, that you make not the place too hot: for too much heate may deſtroy; and therefore
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:114859:39"/> that you muſt ſet the windowes open to let in the cold aire.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We know, that moiſtneſſe of aire rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth ſuch <hi>Inſects,</hi> and nouriſheth them. Indeed if moiſture hurteth, it's becauſe that it too much corrupteth their food, and cauſeth a flux amongſt them: but this eaſily is prevented, as I ſhall ſhew you anon. But to be ſhort, it is not onely my opinion that <hi>Silke-wormes</hi> will thrive here; but the ſolide judgement of <hi>King James</hi> and his Councel confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſame: as you may ſee by his letter to the <hi>Deputy-Lieutenants</hi> of every County; wherein alſo many weighty reaſons are conteined to convince men of the ſame; which letter followeth anon.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we finde by experience, that <hi>Silke-wormes</hi> will thrive here, and therefore the matter is out of queſtion: for divers <hi>Ladies, Gentlewomen, Scholars, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens,</hi> &amp;c. have Nurſed up divers wormes to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, though they have had little skill in the managing of them; and likewiſe not ſuch accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations as are neceſſary for them; and more would they have done, if they could have had <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry-leaves.</hi> I am informed that one neare <hi>Charing-Croſſe</hi> maketh a good living by them: as alſo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>Ratliffe-Croſſe;</hi> and therefore if we can bring up an 100. why not a 1000. yea, 100000. if we had food for them? Truly, I know no reaſon to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, neither could I ever finde one that could ſpeak any thing to the purpoſe againſt the buſines. And further I muſt tell you, that the ordering of this <hi>worme</hi> is very eaſie, none need to be bound prentize to the trade; the ſpeciall buſineſſe is to be carefull in feeding them, and keeping them ſweete; which
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:114859:40"/> things children uſe to do. He that would learne this Art exactly let him read <hi>Boneil,</hi> or an Author W. S. Printed 1609. about <hi>Mulberries,</hi> and ſold in <hi>Paul's Church-yard,</hi> by <hi>Eleaz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Edgar;</hi> but becauſe that the books are out of print, I will give you a few <hi>Rules.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt endeavour to get ſtore of <hi>Mulberry-trees,</hi> which are of 2. ſorts the <hi>white</hi> and the <hi>black.</hi> The <hi>white</hi> groweth greateſt, and hath a fine leafe, and ſweeteſt, and therefore fitteſt for the young wormes. This is eaſily propagated by <hi>Slips,</hi> as <hi>Quinces, Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</hi> The <hi>Black Mulberry</hi> is difficultly propagated by <hi>Slips;</hi> but muſt be raiſed from <hi>ſeeds,</hi> ſowen either at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> when the <hi>Mulberries</hi> are eaten: or kept in dry ſand till the ſpring; and then ſowe or howe them in, as other ſeeds and ſtones, and muſt be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently weeded. This groweth not to be ſo great a tree as the former: the leaves are rougher and harſher, and fitteſt for the wormes. When they are ſtrong and ready to ſpin, when your trees are grown to a good bigneſſe, you may plant them forth, as is uſually don for <hi>Walks</hi> or <hi>Orchards,</hi> or in waſte places, as they do in <hi>Italy,</hi> (for the <hi>Fruit</hi> is little worth, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Leaves</hi> are usefull,) where I have ſeen the trees as bare of leaves at Midſummer as at Midwinter. There are 2. ſorts of <hi>Silke-wormes,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and <hi>Calabrian.</hi> The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> is the ſmaller and more tender, and maketh a finer ſilke. The <hi>Calabrian</hi> is greater and more hardy, and maketh more <hi>Silke,</hi> but courſer. This ſort ſeemeth to be the beſt for this <hi>Countrey.</hi> When the <hi>Mulberry-trees</hi> begin to bud, take the <hi>egs</hi> of your <hi>Silke-wormes,</hi> and lay them on a peece of <hi>ſtuffe</hi> or <hi>ſay,</hi> (ſome uſe to <hi>Bathe</hi> them firſt in warme <hi>Malm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy,</hi> and ſay that it maketh them ſtronger,) and carry
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:114859:40"/> them about you in the day in a <hi>Box,</hi> in the night lay them under your <hi>Bed,</hi> or in a warme <hi>Oven,</hi> till the wormes begin to come forth, then lay a peece of paper of the wideneſſe of the box, cut full of holes, on them, and on the paper lay <hi>Mulberry-leaves,</hi> and as faſt as they hatch they will crawle forth, and ſtick to the <hi>Mulberry-leaves;</hi> which remove into other <hi>boxes,</hi> till all be hatched: then when they have paſt their ſecond ſickneſſe, feed them on <hi>ſhelves</hi> 2. foot broad and 18. inches one from another: the Roome where you keepe your Wormes, muſt neither be a low place, nor nigh the tiles; but a midle Roome, warme and dry, yet ſometimes a little cold aire is good.</p>
               <p>Take heed of <hi>Rats</hi> and <hi>Mice,</hi> as alſo of <hi>Hens, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binred-breſts; Sparrows,</hi> and other birds; for they will eate them.</p>
               <p>They have 4. <hi>Sickneſſes,</hi> the firſt 12. dayes after they are hatched; and from that time at the end of every 8. dayes: their ſickneſſe laſteth 2. or 3. dayes, and then they are to be fed but very little.</p>
               <p>The whole time that the wormes do feed, is about 9. weekes: feed them twice dayly at leaſt: at the firſt when they are ſmall, give them a few leaves; and as they grow greater, more, and feed them oftner. Let your leaves be dry and well aired upon a Table or cloth before you give them; and gather not your leaves, till the dew be off; and in dry ſeaſons if you can poſſibly, you may keepe your leaves gathered 3. or 4. dayes or longer.</p>
               <p>Keepe your <hi>ſhelves</hi> and <hi>boxes</hi> very cleane: but take heed you touch not your wormes with your hands, when you remove them; but move them not when they are ſick.</p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:114859:41"/>
               <p> In cold moiſt weather, ſet a <hi>Pan</hi> of <hi>Coales</hi> in the Roome, and burne a little <hi>Benjamin, Juniper,</hi> &amp;c. e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when they are young, (viz.) the firſt 5. weekes; but afterwards, unleſſe it be extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cold, give them Aire, and keepe them not too hot, and let the Roome be well ſented with <hi>Herbes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let not your <hi>Wormes</hi> be too thick on the ſhelves: if any dy or be ſick, ſpeedily remove them, leaſt they infect the reſt.</p>
               <p>As ſoone as by the cleare Amber-colour of your <hi>wormes,</hi> you perceive that they would ſpin; make <hi>Arches</hi> betwixt your ſhelves, <hi>with heath</hi> made clean, branches of <hi>Roſemary, Lavender</hi> &amp;c. where the <hi>wormes</hi> will faſten themſelves, and make their <hi>bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes</hi> in 2. or 3. dayes, and about 12. or 14. dayes after, will come forth: before which time, you muſt take away the <hi>bottome,</hi> which you will uſe for <hi>Silke,</hi> and kill the worme within, by laying the <hi>bottomes</hi> in the ſun 2. or 3. dayes, or in an hot <hi>Oven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>bottome</hi> which you will keepe for <hi>ſeede,</hi> lay in a warme place, till the <hi>wormes</hi> come forth; which put on ſome peeces of old <hi>ſay, Grogran, Velvet,</hi> made faſt to ſome wall: there they will engender, and the Male having ſpent himſelfe falleth downe and dyeth; ſo the Female, when ſhe hath laid her egs, which egs when they are <hi>gray,</hi> you may gently take them off with a knife, and keepe them in a peece of <hi>Say</hi> in a dry place, till hatching-time come.</p>
               <p>The winding of the <hi>Silke</hi> off the <hi>bottome</hi> requireth a peculiar wheele, which an <hi>Artificer</hi> muſt make: 1. l. and 2. ounces of the bottome yeeldeth from 1. ounce to 3. of <hi>Silke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An ounce of <hi>Spaniſh ſeed</hi> yeeldeth ordinarily 8. or.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:114859:41"/> 10. l. of <hi>Silk,</hi> and the <hi>wormes</hi> will eat 250. l. of <hi>leaves:</hi> the <hi>Calabrian wormes</hi> being greater, do eat nigh 300. weight, and yeeld 11. or 12. l. of <hi>Silke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, I deſire all men ſeriouſly to conſider, what Advantage this buſineſſe will bring to this <hi>Iſland,</hi> if it be brought to perfection. Truly I know nothing doth hinder but want of <hi>Mulberry-trees,</hi> which will in little ſpace come to a conſiderable greatneſſe. And though I commend thoſe, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to advance this worke in <hi>Plantations,</hi> and prefer it before <hi>Tobacco;</hi> yet I know that it cannot be for want of hands; whereas here in <hi>England</hi> we have plenty of women, children, old folkes, lame, decrepite, &amp;c. who are fit to be overſeers of this worke. And I wonder <hi>Gentlemen</hi> do not go obout a thing ſo pleaſant and profitable, (for 3 4. or 5. at the moſt will attend as many <hi>wormes,</hi> as will make 40. or 50. l. worth of <hi>Silke</hi> in 2. or 3. moneths) and the <hi>wormes</hi> eate only leaves, which are of no value: neither is there any conſiderable trouble about the <hi>wormes</hi> unleſſe it be the 12. or 15. laſt dayes. I hope, if that particular men will not endeavour to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance this worke, for their private profit; yet the <hi>State</hi> will for the <hi>Publique Good;</hi> it being the beſt way I know, to ſet all the poor children, Widowes, old and lame people on worke: and likewiſe will ſave this <hi>Nation</hi> many 100. thouſand pounds <hi>per annum.</hi> And further, the way to accompliſh this work may be done without grievance to the <hi>Subject, (viz.)</hi> to command every one to plant or ſowe ſo many <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry-ſeeds</hi> which may eaſily be procured from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Seas &amp;c. But I leave States-matters to <hi>States-men,</hi> I am none.</p>

               <p>But ſome will object, that they will not grow here with us, for your forefathers never uſed them. To theſe I reply, and aske them, how they know? have they tryed? Idleneſſe never wants an excuſe; and why might not our forefathers upon the ſame ground, have held their hands in their pockets, and have ſaid, that <hi>Wheate, Barly,</hi> would not have grown amongſt us? and why ſhould not they have beene diſcouraged from planting <hi>Cherries, Hops, Licoriſh, Potatoes, Apricockes, Peaches, Melicotones,</hi> and from ſowing <hi>Rape-ſeeds, Colliflowers, great Clover, Canary-ſeeds</hi> &amp;c. and many more of this kinde? and yet we know, that moſt of theſe have beene brought to

But to returne to our purpoſe, I ſay that in <hi>Husbandry</hi> it is even ſo. For the Aunti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents uſed divers plants which we know not; as the <hi>Cytiſus-tree,</hi> ſo much commended for Cattel; as alſo their <hi>Medick</hi> fodder, which <hi>Colum.</hi> ſaith, endureth 10. years, and may be mowen 4. yeares, 7. times in a yeare: &amp; one Acre he eſteemeth enough for 3. horſes. This fodder likewiſe is accounted very ſweete and healthful, whereas the plants which are uſually called <hi>Medicaes</hi> with us, are Annual plants, and have no ſuch rare proprieties. So we are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant what graine their <hi>Far,</hi> or fine Bread Corne was, what their <hi>Lupine, Spury,</hi> and a 100. of this kinde, as you may reade in <hi>Matthiol.</hi> or <hi>Dioſcorides:</hi> ſo on the contrary, infinite are the Plants which we have, and they knew not; as well appeareth by their ſmall
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:114859:45"/> and our large <hi>Herballs;</hi> and dayly new Plants are diſcovered, uſeful for <hi>Husbandry, Mechanichs</hi> and <hi>Phyſick,</hi> and therefore let no man be diſcouraged, from proſecuting new and laudable <hi>Ingenuities.</hi> And I deſire <hi>Ingenious Gentlemen</hi> and <hi>Merchants,</hi> who travel beyond Sea, to take notice of the <hi>Husbandry</hi> of thoſe parts (viz.) what graines they ſowe? at what time and ſeaſons? on what lands? how they plough their lands? how they dung and improve them? what cattel they uſe, and the Commodities there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by?

But ſome will object and ſay, that many things are of little worth and profit. To theſe I Anſwer, that God hath made nothing in vaine: every thing hath his peculiar uſe, and though ſome things ſeem to be of little worth and contemptible, as <hi>Sand, Loame, Chalke;</hi> yet it hath pleaſed the wiſe Creator to make theſe things very neceſſary for mans comfortable ſubſiſtance, which they that want theſe things can teſtify: As for example in <hi>New-England,</hi> where there is no <hi>Chalke</hi> nor <hi>Lime-stone,</hi> they are compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, to burne <hi>Oyster ſhells, Cocles,</hi> to make <hi>Lime;</hi> or elſe they could hardly build any houſes. The like I may ſay of <hi>Sand</hi> and <hi>Loame</hi> in divers places, where they are wanting.</p>
               <p>2. I ſay that moſt of thoſe things I have ſpoken of, are very profitable in one place or other. To inſtance in ſome of the meaner ſort; at <hi>London Brick-men</hi> give 50. l. <hi>per</hi> Acre, onely for <hi>loame</hi> to make <hi>brickes,</hi> and pay 3. l. <hi>per</hi> Acre, of yearly Rent, and are to leave the land worth the ſame yearly Rent; likewiſe I know a <hi>Chalke-cliffe</hi> in <hi>Kent</hi> not 2. Acres of ground, valued at many 100. l. and that one <hi>Colume</hi> of <hi>Chalke</hi> which is 10. foot ſquare, is valued at 40 or 50 l. at 8. d. <hi>per</hi> loade: The <hi>Oker Mines</hi> of <hi>Oxford and Gloceſter-ſhire</hi> are of great value: and ſo would others of that kind, if they could be found; ſo is the <hi>Black-leade Mine.</hi> Alſo the pits of <hi>Clay, Marle, Coale, Turffe</hi> &amp;c.

This ignorance cauſeth them to admire and to eſteem even as <hi>miraculous,</hi> ordinary and <hi>triviall</hi> things; as for example, how it cometh to paſſe that in one <hi>Meadow</hi> an <hi>Horſe</hi> thriveth very much and ſpeedily, and yet a <hi>Bullocke</hi> will not in that place: and contrariwiſe in a <hi>Meadow</hi> cloſe by the former, the <hi>Bullock</hi> will thrive, and the <hi>Horſe</hi> not: ſo alſo how it cometh to paſſe that <hi>Conyes</hi> and <hi>Sheepe</hi> will thrive well, where there is <hi>ſcarcely</hi> any <hi>Paſture,</hi> and yet come to nothing on <hi>Commons,</hi> where there is a greater quantity of <hi>Paſture;</hi> which proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from this cauſe, that ſomekinde of Plants are more agreeing and ſweeter to one ſort of Cattel then to another, and every beaſt almoſt hath ſome Plant or other, which they love exceedingly. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the obſervances of this kinde, might be very uſeful in Husbandry. Theſe <hi>Deficiencies</hi> I will draw to 3. heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſay that divers <hi>Plants</hi> (not to ſpeak of <hi>Fruits,</hi> becauſe we have already ſpoken of them) that grow naturally in our <hi>Iſland,</hi> may be very ſerviceable to the <hi>Husbandman,</hi> both for his <hi>Paſtures &amp; Corne-</hi>lands. To inſtance in ſome few: we ſee that divers ſorts of wild <hi>Vetches, Chiches, Tares,</hi> &amp;c. grow wild in divers places, which though they beare not ſo great and large crops, as ſome others already uſed; yet who knoweth what they would do, if they were manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as other graines, and in land proper for them: for we ſee that the tranſplanting of Plants into <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi> doth very much <hi>meliorate</hi> or better them; and without doubt all thoſe graines, which are in uſe with us, were at firſt picked out of the field and woods; and by <hi>Ingenious</hi> men found uſeful for man or beaſt; and of late divers have been found, not
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:114859:51"/> knowne to our Forefathers, as <hi>Saint Foine, Lucerne;</hi> and why may not we finde divers <hi>Graſſes, Vetches, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaes, Wild Peaſe,</hi> &amp;c. which as yet are ſcarce taken notice of?</p>
               <p n="2">2. There grow divers ſorts of wilde <hi>Peaſe,</hi> but to ſpeak of 2. onely.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sort which groweth on the ſtony <hi>beaches</hi> of the Sea, where there is little or no earth, the rootes are many foot deepe in the ground. In <hi>Queene Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> dayes in a dearth, the poor people gathered di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſackes full of them, and they were no ſmall reliefe to them: who hath tryed, whether they would thrive better on better land?</p>
               <p n="2">2. ſort groweth on dry barren land, and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the <hi>everlasting Peaſe;</hi> which continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally groweth out of the ſame roote. In Gardens I have ſeene it grow 10. yeares together, and larger at the 10. years end, then at the firſt. I have alſo ſeen it flouriſh on <hi>barren grounds,</hi> where <hi>Oates</hi> were burnt away: who knoweth but theſe and other Plants may be ſerviceable, if not for <hi>man</hi> at leaſt to <hi>beaſts,</hi> or <hi>Pigeons?</hi> for in <hi>New-England,</hi> the great flights of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons</hi> are much maintained by theſe; I am ſure it were good to make experiments on theſe, and divers others.</p>
               <p>2. Head, is the <hi>Ignorance of the Mechanical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes</hi> of <hi>Herbs</hi> and <hi>Trees;</hi> for even for theſe <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes</hi> moſt Plants have ſome peculiar propriety. To inſtance in a few. We know that <hi>Elme</hi> is for <hi>Wheels;</hi> and the beſt wood for to make <hi>Herrings red, Oake</hi> is for the <hi>Shipwright, Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Tanner; Horne-beames Beech,</hi> for the <hi>Millwright; Line-tree</hi> for <hi>baſe ropes, Old Elder</hi> without pith is very tough &amp; fit for <hi>Cogs of wheeles, Tooth Pickers; Pear-tree</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:114859:51"/> for <hi>Mathematicall Inſtruments</hi> and <hi>Engravers</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Oſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> for Baskets; <hi>Walnut</hi> for <hi>Gunſtockes; Aſpe</hi> for <hi>Hoopes; Box, Aſh</hi> for a 100. uſes; and much more might be ſpoken of this kind, if time would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. So likewiſe divers Plants are for Painters, as you may ſee in <hi>Batte's Experiments:</hi> ſome for the <hi>Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> but as yet we know but 4. (viz. <hi>Woade, Would, Green-wood,</hi> and <hi>Madder)</hi> amongſt 1200. plants and upward, which grow wilde with us. I could wiſh ſome <hi>Ingenious</hi> man would take the paines to ſearch out the <hi>Mechanicall <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes</hi> of Plants; ſurely it were a good way to advance <hi>Mechanickes,</hi> who in their callings uſually go round, as the cauſes of their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. I know a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> who promiſeth ſome things in this kinde, and I hope will be as good as his word.</p>
               <p>3. Head, the is ignorance of the <hi>Phyſioal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes</hi> of <hi>Plants:</hi> for though very many 100. <hi>Plants</hi> do grow <hi>amongſt</hi> us; yet but few of them are uſed <hi>Phyſically:</hi> wheras there is ſcarce any one, but may be uſeful in this kind. And truly in my <hi>opinion</hi> it is a great fault, that we ſo much admire thoſe things, that are far fetcht and deere bought; when as oft-times they are gathered in unſeaſonable times, and corrupted by long voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges by ſea, counterfeited by Merchants; yea we have very oft <hi>Quid pro quo,</hi> and ranke poyſons, and do neglect thoſe <hi>Medicines</hi> which God hath given us here at home. I am credibly informed, that in former times, <hi>Virga Aurea</hi> was in great uſe with us, and uſually ſold for 8. d. <hi>per</hi> ounce, and brought from <hi>France:</hi> but ſo ſoone as it was found growing plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully in our hedges, it was caſt forth of the <hi>Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries</hi> ſhops, as of little vertue. And though ſome will object, that our Plants have little vertue: I ſay it's falſe; for God hath tempered them for on Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions:
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:114859:52"/> and we ſee that very oft one <hi>ſimple Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine</hi> doth more good then the great <hi>Compoſitions</hi> of the <hi>Auncients,</hi> which are rather <hi>ad pompam</hi> then for health, and ſeeme to ſavour ſomewhat of the <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebanke;</hi> becauſe <hi>Opium</hi> is alwayes an ingredient. And further we ſee, that where any <hi>Endemicall</hi> or <hi>National diſeaſe</hi> reigneth, there God hath alſo plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>ſpecifique</hi> for it: As the <hi>Cochleare</hi> or <hi>Scurvy-graſſe</hi> for the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> in the <hi>Balticke</hi> Sea, where it is very frequent, and alſo in <hi>Holland, England.</hi> So in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> (from whence the great <hi>Pox</hi> firſt came, and where it reigneth very much, that not onely man, but other Creatures are infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, ſo that even <hi>Dogs</hi> dye of that diſeaſe in our <hi>Northerne Plantations,</hi> perhaps catching this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, by mingling with <hi>Indian dogs,)</hi> there grow the <hi>ſpecifiques</hi> for this diſeaſe, as <hi>Gujacum, Saſſaperilla, Saſſafras,</hi> and the <hi>Salvages</hi> do eaſily cure theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper. Further we ſee, that even the <hi>Irrational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> can finde not onely <hi>meate,</hi> but alſo <hi>Medicines</hi> for themſelves; as the <hi>Dog, Couchgraſſe</hi> for a vomit: the <hi>Dove, Vervein;</hi> the <hi>Weaſell, Rue;</hi> the <hi>Swallow, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landine;</hi> the <hi>Toade Plantine;</hi> and where is our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that we cannot?</p>
               <p>I therefore deſire all Countrey-people, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to know theſe Plants which grow at their doores: (for God hath not planted them there for no purpoſe; for he doth nothing in vaine,) and to collect together the plain <hi>ſimple Medicaments</hi> of their <hi>Grandame;</hi> by this meanes they may ſave many a 40. dence: I meane preſerve themſelves and families, and Neighbours, in good health Some ſmall <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes</hi> have of late been written, to ſhew the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:114859:52"/> our Plants, in <hi>Phyſicke;</hi> and I hope Ingenious men will dayly more and more communicate the <hi>Secrets</hi> of this kinde, which they have in their hands, for the <hi>Publique Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They that write of 4 <hi>footed beaſts,</hi> do reckon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <note place="margin" type="runSum">18. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.</hi>
                  </note> 120. <hi>ſpecies</hi> of them: halfe of them are ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowne amongſt us. I do ſuppoſe therefore, that divers <hi>ſpecies</hi> are wanting, which may be uſefull. To inſtance in ſome: And</p>
               <p n="1">1. To begin with the <hi>Elephant,</hi> the greateſt, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt, and longeſt-lived of all beaſts: which abound very much in the Eaſterne parts of the world; as <hi>China, India:</hi> and are accounted very ſerviceable, both for the warres, and for carriage (15. men u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually riding on his backe together,) they are not chargeable to keepe; why may they not be of uſe even here, when I am credibly informed, an <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant</hi> lived divers years here in a Parke? ſo that they can endure the coldneſſe of this <hi>Climate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Buffle,</hi> which is as big as an <hi>Ox,</hi> and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable both for the plough, and for their milke: their skins make the beſt <hi>buffe,</hi> they will fare very hard, and live in <hi>Fens</hi> and <hi>bogs,</hi> where nothing elſe can. In the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Floernce's</hi> Countrey neare <hi>Piſa,</hi> are many of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The honeſt and patient <hi>Aſſe,</hi> which was very much uſed in the old time for <hi>carriage,</hi> (as the <hi>Horſe</hi> for the <hi>warre,</hi> and the <hi>Oxe</hi> for the <hi>plough,)</hi> and in many <hi>Countreyes</hi> at this time, they will eate <hi>thiſtles,</hi> and live even with nothing. They may ſave poore men (who are not able to keepe an <hi>Horſe,</hi> becauſe he is a great feeder,) much labour.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Mules,</hi> which is a very ſtrong and proud beaſt,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:114859:53"/> and will carry far more then an <hi>Horſe,</hi> and are more ſure-footed. I ſuppoſe, that they might be ſerviceable to the Carriers here, as they are beyond the Seas.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Black Foxes,</hi> may be profitable; whoſe skins have been fold from 20. l. <hi>per</hi> skin to 90. l. I might add divers more of this kind: as <hi>Muske-cats, Sables, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, Minkes, Musk Squaſh, Guiney-pigs,</hi> and a ſort of Cony, which ſome few have in <hi>Hamp-ſhire,</hi> whoſe <hi>Furr</hi> is worth 2. s. 6. s. or 3. s. <hi>per</hi> skin, being little inferiour to <hi>Beaver,</hi> &amp;c. but for brevities ſake I paſſe them over: as alſo divers ſorts of <hi>Fowles,</hi> of good uſe; as a kind of <hi>Ducke</hi> with a <hi>Crooked bill,</hi> which layeth conſtantly as <hi>Hens</hi> do, as alſo <hi>Hawkes</hi> of diver; ſorts, of good value, which perhaps the <hi>Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> loveth not; becauſe they are enemies to his <hi>Poultry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Deficiency,</hi> is that we do not endeavour to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the beſt kinds of theſe Cattel, which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us. And</p>
               <p n="1">1. To begin with <hi>Horſes.</hi> The <hi>French-man</hi> that wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a booke called the <hi>Treaſure Politick,</hi> ſaith, that in <hi>England in Qu. Eliz.</hi> dayes, we had not above 3. or 4000. <hi>Horſe</hi> worth any thing for the war, &amp; thoſe onely in <hi>Noblemens</hi> ſtables; which thing perhaps did the more encourage the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to invade us: but at this time we are known to have very many 1000. of <hi>Horſe,</hi> not inferiour to the beſt in the world: yet I ſuppoſe, that we might much <hi>meliorate</hi> our breed by <hi>Spaniſh Jennets, Barbary,</hi> &amp;c. And we are not ſo careful to encreaſe good <hi>Horſes,</hi> as we ſhould be.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are too negligent in our <hi>Kine,</hi> that we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance not the beſt <hi>ſpecies:</hi> for ſome ſorts give abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of milke, and better then others: ſome ſorts
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:114859:53"/> are larger, more hardy, and will ſooner fat, &amp;c. <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> and ſome few <hi>Northerne Counties,</hi> are the onely places, where they are a little careful in theſe particulars.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We are not curious in procuring the beſt ſorts of <hi>Sheepe,</hi> for greatneſſe, foundneſſe, and fine wooll. I wonder that ſome of our <hi>Sheep-masters</hi> have not procured of thoſe exceeding <hi>fine-woolled Sheepe</hi> of <hi>Spaine;</hi> whoſe <hi>wooll</hi> coſteth the <hi>Merchant</hi> nigh 10. s. <hi>per</hi> pound, before it is exported: I ſuppoſe, that it would for a time mend our <hi>wooll,</hi> if not continue ſo for ever: for theſe <hi>Sheep</hi> were firſt carryed forth out of <hi>England,</hi> if we may beleeve ſtories, <hi>Spaine</hi> not affoarding ſuch Sheepe before. <hi>Dutch Sheepe</hi> are reported to have 2. or 3. <hi>Lambes</hi> ordinarily. <hi>Dutch Sheepe</hi> are very great with <hi>greate tales;</hi> but their <hi>wooll</hi> is very courſe, not onely becauſe of their courſe feeding; but alſo becauſe in hot <hi>Countries,</hi> they ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily mingle with <hi>Goats;</hi> and therefore in <hi>Venice</hi> ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>Porters</hi> will ſcarcely eate any <hi>Mutton.</hi> And here I cannot but relate, that all ſtrangers very much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at 2. things in our <hi>Sheepe,</hi> (not to ſpeak of the <hi>fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> of <hi>wooll.)</hi> And</p>
               <p n="1">1. That our <hi>Sheepe</hi> if they be ſound, ſeldome or never drink, even in Summer; though they go on the dryeſt <hi>Chalky lands:</hi> as it plainly appeareth in <hi>Kent,</hi> where there is ſcarce water for the great cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel; which proceedeth from the moiſture of our aire, and abundance of Raines and dewes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That our <hi>Sheepe</hi> do not follow their <hi>ſhepherds,</hi> as they do in all other <hi>Countries:</hi> for the <hi>ſhepherd</hi> goeth before, and the <hi>Sheepe</hi> follow like to a pack of <hi>dogs;</hi> this diſobedience of our <hi>Sheepe,</hi> doth not happen to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:114859:54"/> us, as <hi>Papist-Prieſts</hi> tell their <hi>ſimple flocks;</hi> becauſe we have left their great <hi>ſhepherd</hi> the <hi>Pope;</hi> but becauſe we let our <hi>Sheep</hi> range night and day in our fields without a <hi>ſhepherd;</hi> which other Countries dare not for feare of <hi>Wolves</hi> and other ravenous beaſts, but are compelled to guard them all day with great <hi>dogs,</hi> and to bring them home at night, or to watch them in their <hi>folds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Deficiency</hi> in this kind, is the <hi>neglect</hi> of <hi>Fiſh-ponds,</hi> which are very profitable: for <hi>Fiſh</hi> uſually live by ſuch <hi>wormes</hi> and <hi>flies</hi> as are engendred in the <hi>ponds,</hi> and require no charge. Concerning the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of them, and the profit of them, Read Mr. <hi>Vaughans Golden Grove.</hi> And ſurely it would be a great benefit to this Iſland, if we had <hi>Fiſh</hi> at reaſonable rates. I cannot therefore paſſe by two extreame <hi>Abuſes,</hi> which exceedingly deſtroy <hi>Fiſh,</hi> and are in no wiſe to be permitted.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That divers poore men keepe many <hi>Swine,</hi> and in nets, or otherwiſe catch many buſhels of the young fry of <hi>Fiſh,</hi> and feed their <hi>Swine</hi> with them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the <hi>Fiſher-men</hi> in the <hi>River</hi> have the meaſhes of their <hi>nets</hi> ſo ſtraight, that they take ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſorts of <hi>Fiſh</hi> when they are too ſmall, and do deſtroy farre more <hi>Fiſh</hi> then they take. I hope theſe <hi>Abuſes</hi> will be reformed with all ſeverity. To this head I may add <hi>Decoyes,</hi> which are very frequent in <hi>Holland,</hi> and profitable; but very rare with us in <hi>England:</hi> yet may be very profitable and delightful.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Dificiency,</hi> is the <hi>Ignorance</hi> of the <hi>Inſects</hi> of this <hi>Iſland.</hi> And though it may ſeeme ridiculous to many, to affirme that <hi>Magots, butterflies,</hi> ſhould be of any importance; yet I deſire them to conſider, that we
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:114859:54"/> have our <hi>Honey,</hi> the ſweeteſt of foods from <hi>Bees,</hi> which are cattel of this kinde: alſo all our <hi>Silkes, Sattins, Pluſhes,</hi> and bravery from the poore <hi>Silke-worme,</hi> which may be called a <hi>Magot, Caterpillar,</hi> or <hi>Butter-flie</hi> &amp;c. the richeſt of our <hi>Colours</hi> from the <hi>Cocheneile,</hi> which is one of this ſort. <hi>Gum-lac</hi> is made by <hi>Aunts,</hi> ſome are uſed for food, as <hi>Locuſts,</hi> &amp;c. as you may reade in <hi>Muſſet's Book de Inſectis.</hi> Many of theſe likewiſe are uſed in <hi>Phyſick,</hi> as <hi>Cantharides, Wood-ſowes, Lice,</hi> &amp;c. Some think, that <hi>Medicines</hi> tranſcending even the <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> may be had out of theſe; for every <hi>Plant,</hi> which hath a <hi>Medicinal</hi> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, is alſo <hi>ſublimed</hi> up into this living <hi>Quinteſſence:</hi> &amp; therefore I commend divers ingenious men, as Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi> and others, who have collected many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſorts of theſe; and I hope they will communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ere long their experiments to the world.</p>
               <p>19. <hi>Deficiency concerning divers things neceſſary for the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">19. <hi>Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning divers things neceſſary for the good of Cattel.</hi>

                  <hi>good of Cattel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That we are ignorant of the divers <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> of Cattel &amp; their <hi>Cures.</hi> Not to run over all the <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> of Cattel and their <hi>Cures,</hi> which would be too long, and you may read them in Mr. <hi>Marram's</hi> workes, <hi>The Countrey-Farmer,</hi> and others. I will inſtance onely in two, which ſome years ſweepe away Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, as the <hi>Plague</hi> doth men, (viz.) the <hi>Murreine</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt <hi>Great Cattel,</hi> and the <hi>Rot</hi> amongſt <hi>Sheep.</hi> And though divers have wrote concerning the <hi>Cures</hi> of theſe <hi>Diſeaſes;</hi> yet we do not finde that effect which we deſire: and therefore I hope ſome will attempt to ſupply this <hi>Deficiency,</hi> and write a good <hi>Treatiſe</hi> about the <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> of <hi>Cattel.</hi> Of theſe 2. <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> I ſhall briefly declare my minde: And</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of the <hi>Murreine,</hi> which proceedeth from an
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:114859:55"/> Inflammation of the blood, and cauſeth a ſwelling in the throate, which in little time ſuffocateth the cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel. The eſpecial <hi>Cauſes</hi> of this <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> are an hot and dry ſeaſon of the year; which dryeth up the waters, or at leaſt doth ſo putrefie them, that they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome: and alſo the letting of Carrionly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buried. This <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> is thought to be infectious; but perhaps it may proceede from one <hi>Common Cauſe,</hi> as the <hi>Rottenneſſe</hi> of <hi>Sheepe.</hi> The beſt way to keepe your cattel from this <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> is to let them ſtand in coole places in Summer, and to have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of good water, and ſpeedily to bury all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion: and if any of your Cattel be infected, ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to let them bloud, and to give them a good drench &amp;c. by theſe <hi>Meanes</hi> divers have preſerved their cattel; when their Neighbours have periſhed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Concerning the <hi>Rot</hi> of <hi>Sheepe:</hi> not to ſpeake of the <hi>Pelt-Rot,</hi> or <hi>Sheepe</hi> that are ſtarved; but of the <hi>Ordinary Rot,</hi> called by ſome the <hi>White Rot;</hi> and is a kinde of <hi>Dropſey:</hi> their bellies are full of water and their liver diſcoloured. I have ſeen out of the livers of <hi>Sheepe</hi> tending to <hi>Rottenneſſe,</hi> living creatures leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like ſmall <hi>Flounders:</hi> which without queſtion in little time will deſtroy the liver, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently produce an indiſpoſition not unlike to the <hi>Rot.</hi> The common people ſay, that theſe <hi>wormes</hi> are cauſed by the over-heatings of <hi>Sheepe,</hi> and that <hi>Rottenneſſe</hi> proceedeth from a plant called <hi>Cotyledon,</hi> or <hi>Marſh-Penny-wort,</hi> which is of a very ſharpe taſte, and therefore not likely that <hi>Sheepe</hi> will eate it; but it may be a ſigne of wet rotten land, as <hi>broome</hi> is of ſound and dry land.

                  <hi>Sheepe</hi> dy very much of the <hi>Rot;</hi> and in dry years on the ſame ground, they hold ſound: and yet I have heard that in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which is farre moiſter then <hi>England, Rottenneſſe</hi> of <hi>Sheepe</hi> is not known. It were therefore well worth the labour of an <hi>Ingenious man,</hi> to inquire into the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of theſe <hi>Indiſpoſitions</hi> in <hi>Sheepe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Meanes,</hi> which have been found very effectual for the <hi>curing</hi> theſe <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> are theſe: firſt, to drive your <hi>ſheepe</hi> up to dry lands, or to keepe them in the fold, till the dew be off the graſſe, or to feed them ſome dayes with fine dry hay, eſpecially of <hi>Salt Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,</hi> or to put them into <hi>Salt-Marſhes;</hi> for in thoſe places <hi>Sheepe</hi> never <hi>Rot,</hi> or to drive them to ſome ſalt <hi>River,</hi> and there to waſh them, and make them drink of the water, this will kil the <hi>Scab;</hi> and alſo the <hi>tickes,</hi> and faſten the <hi>wooll;</hi> but if you have not the conveniencies before ſaid; then Rub their teeth with ſalt, or rather make a ſtrong pickle with ſalt and water, and force them to drinke thereof. Some dry pitch in an oven, and add to the pickle, and have found very good ſucceſſe: for theſe Medicines do <hi>exſiccate</hi> the ſuperfluous humidities, open obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and kill <hi>wormes.</hi> Some commend the <hi>Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Cup,</hi> as a <hi>Catholick Medicine</hi> againſt all <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> of Cattel.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are Ignorant of divers <hi>Ingenuities,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>feeding</hi> and <hi>fatting</hi> of Cattel and other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. To inſtance in ſome: And</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of the <hi>Horſe</hi> who is a great feeder. In <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Hartford-ſhire</hi> they uſually cut all their <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Peaſe</hi> ſmall, and give them with their <hi>Chaffe;</hi> by this meanes the <hi>Horſes</hi> ſooner fill themſelves, and eate
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:114859:56"/> all the <hi>ſtraw</hi> up: ſome put this <hi>Horſemeat</hi> into a bag, and ſo order it that a little only lyeth in the <hi>Manger;</hi> which when that is eaten up, more falleth down, and not before; by this way <hi>Horſes</hi> do not blow their meate, nor throw it out of the <hi>Manger</hi> with their noſes. A further good peece of <hi>Husbandry</hi> they uſe, which is this, when their <hi>Horſes</hi> are well fed at night, they fill the <hi>rack</hi> with <hi>Wheate</hi> or <hi>Barly-ſtraw,</hi> and ſo leave them; the <hi>Horſe</hi> perceiving that that which is in the <hi>rack</hi> is not very pleaſant, lyeth down and taketh his reſt, which is as good to him as his meate: if he riſe in the night, and fall to the <hi>rack</hi> and <hi>Manger,</hi> as he uſually doth, and findeth nothing but <hi>ſtraw,</hi> he ſleepeth till the morning; but if it be <hi>Hay, Tares,</hi> or <hi>Peaſe,</hi> the <hi>Jade</hi> will pull it all down and ſpoile it, and likewiſe will be hindred from his reſt; by the which double damage doth enſue. <hi>Currying</hi> and <hi>dreſſing</hi> of <hi>Horſes</hi> ought not to be forgot, it is halfe as good as their meate. <hi>Brimſtone</hi> and <hi>Elecam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pane</hi> rootes are the eſpeciall <hi>Ingredients</hi> for this <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Of the feeding and <hi>fatting</hi> of <hi>Cowes.</hi> We uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feed Cattel with <hi>straw</hi> in <hi>rackes</hi> in the yard, or turne them to the fields, and there let them feed as much; and how they pleaſe; which hath many <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies:</hi> as firſt, cattel ſpoile as much with their heeles as they eate, eſpecially if the ground be moiſt, or if the flie be very troubleſome, and they blow and ſtench and tumble much, and if the flie be buſie, they run up and downe, and over-heate themſelves, and fat very little; ſo that oftentimes in <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July</hi> they fatten as little as at <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> and moſt of their dung is loſt by theſe meanes &amp;c. But
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:114859:56"/> in <hi>Holland</hi> they do thus: They keepe their cattel houſed Winter and Summer; for the <hi>Winter-provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> they lay in not only <hi>hay,</hi> but alſo <hi>graines,</hi> (which they buy in the Summer, and bury in the ground:) and alſo <hi>Rape-ſeed Cakes,</hi> and ſowe <hi>Turnips,</hi> not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for themſelves, but their <hi>Cowes</hi> alſo; with the which <hi>Turnips</hi> being ſliced, and their <hi>tops,</hi> and <hi>Rape-Cakes,</hi> and <hi>graines</hi> &amp;c. they make <hi>Meſhes</hi> for their <hi>Cowes,</hi> and give it them warme; which the <hi>Cowes</hi> will ſlop up like <hi>Hogs,</hi> and by this meanes, they give very much <hi>Milke.</hi> In the Summer-time, they mowe the great <hi>Clover-graſſe,</hi> and give it them in <hi>ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>kes;</hi> ſo that their cattel are not troubled with the pinching froſts, nor rains, nor with the parching Sun in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, neither with the flie, nor do they over-heate themſelves or ſpoile halfe ſo much meate; and are alwayes as fat as their <hi>Maſters,</hi> or <hi>Bacon-hogs.</hi> The <hi>Dung</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi> they charily preſerve, and thereby keepe their <hi>Meadowes</hi> of <hi>Clover-graſſe</hi> (which are conſtantly mowen twice or thrice yearly) in good heart: &amp; indeed cattel ought not to go amongſt <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-graſſe,</hi> becauſe it uſually groweth with long <hi>Haume</hi> (as they call it) like <hi>Peaſe,</hi> which if it be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken will not thrive. In <hi>Barmudaes</hi> they have a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar way of fattening their cattel, not uſed any where elſe that I know, which is with <hi>Greene Fennell,</hi> that groweth in that <hi>Iſland</hi> plentifully.</p>
               <p>There is a plant in <hi>Eſſex</hi> called <hi>Myrchis,</hi> or <hi>Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purſley,</hi> which groweth faſt and early in the ſpring, which they give their cattel at the beginning of the yeare, and they eate it well.</p>
               <p>It is an ill cuſtome that is uſed almoſt every where, to let <hi>Hogs</hi> ly in their <hi>Dirt</hi> and <hi>Dung,</hi> when they
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:114859:57"/> are <hi>fattening;</hi> for all creatures Generally do hate and abhorre their owne <hi>Dung:</hi> and an <hi>Hog</hi> is the cleanlieſt of all creatures, and will never <hi>dung</hi> nor <hi>ſtale</hi> in his <hi>Sty,</hi> if he can get forth, which other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures will: and though he tumble in the dirt in Summer; yet that is partly to coole himſelfe, and partly to kill his <hi>Lice,</hi> for when the <hi>dirt</hi> is dry, he rubbeth it off and deſtroyeth the <hi>Lice</hi> thereby.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Hugh Plattes</hi> in his writings ſetteth down divers <hi>Ingenious wayes,</hi> of <hi>Fattening Poultry</hi> &amp;c. and more may be found out dayly. The <hi>Jewes</hi> have a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar way of <hi>fattening Geeſe,</hi> with <hi>Milke, Figs, Raiſins,</hi> and other ſweete things; by the which they make the liver of an extraordinary greatneſſe, and is a diſh much valued by them.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Moore-fields</hi> there is one that keepeth many 100. of <hi>Conyes,</hi> with <hi>graines</hi> and <hi>branne:</hi> and ſome others who keepe the great laying <hi>Duckes,</hi> with theſe things and <hi>bloud,</hi> to their great advantage. I have ſeene a Booke tranſlated out of <hi>French,</hi> which teacheth how to gaine divers 100. l. <hi>per annum.</hi> by 50. l. ſtock in <hi>Hens.</hi> I ſuppoſe that about <hi>London,</hi> where <hi>eggs</hi> are ſo deere, great profit might be made by them. <hi>Turkeyes</hi> may be kept with good profit, where there are many <hi>Meadowes,</hi> as in <hi>Soffolke.</hi> In <hi>Barke-ſhire</hi> many keepe tame <hi>Pheaſants,</hi> and have gained well thereby.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We do not know how to improve the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities proceeding from Cattel to the higheſt: as for example, our ordinary <hi>Eutter</hi> might be better <hi>ſented</hi> and <hi>tasted:</hi> ſome <hi>Ladies</hi> have fine <hi>Ingenuities</hi> in this kinde. We cannot make <hi>Cheeſe</hi> comparable to the <hi>Parmiſan,</hi> nor ſo <hi>good</hi> as the <hi>Angelots</hi> of <hi>France:</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:114859:57"/> our ordinary <hi>Cheeſe</hi> is not comparable to the <hi>Holland Cheeſes,</hi> where alſo divers ſorts of <hi>Cheeſes</hi> are made of divers Colours: but I cannot much commend their <hi>Green Cheeſes,</hi> which are made of that <hi>Colour</hi> by <hi>Sheepes-dung</hi> &amp;c. but I hope that in little time, our good <hi>Houſewives</hi> will ſcorn that any ſhall excel them.</p>
               <p>20. <hi>Deficiency,</hi> is <hi>The want of divers things, which</hi> 
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">20 <hi>Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, Of the want of divers things, which are neceſſary for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuture.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>are neceſſary for the accompliſhment of Agriculture—</hi>As</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we have not a <hi>Systema</hi> or compleat <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>all the parts of Agriculture.</hi> Till the latter end of <hi>Qu. Eliz.</hi> dayes, I ſuppoſe that there was ſcarce a booke wrote of this ſubject; I never ſaw or heard of any. About that time: <hi>Tuſſer</hi> made his verſes, and <hi>Scot</hi> wrote about a <hi>Hop-garden, Gouge</hi> tranſlated ſome things. Lately divers ſmall <hi>Treatiſes</hi> have been made by divers, as Sir <hi>Hugh Plattes, Gab. Plattes, Markham, Blith</hi> and <hi>Butler,</hi> who do well in divers things; but their bookes cannot be called compleat Bookes, as you may perceive by divers particular things, not ſo much mentioned by them. The <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Farmer</hi> tranſlated out of <hi>French</hi> is enough, if not more than enough; but it's no waies framed, or ſquared for us here in <hi>England:</hi> and I feare, the firſt <hi>Authors</hi> went on probabilities and hearſaies rather then experience. I hope ſome <hi>Ingenious</hi> man will be encouraged, to undertake a work ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and commendable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Deficiency</hi> is, that <hi>Gentlemen</hi> try ſo few Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments for the avdance of this honeſt and Laborious Calling; when as many Experiments might be made for a ſmall matter: for halfe a Pole ſquare, will give as certain a demonſtration, as an Acre; and a Pottle as a Hogſhead. I hope in time there will be erected a
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:114859:58"/> 
                  <hi>Colledge of Experiments,</hi> not only for this, but alſo all other <hi>Mechanicall Arts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Deficiency</hi> is, That <hi>Gentlemen</hi> and <hi>Farmers</hi> do not meet and communicate ſecrets in this kind, but keep what they have experimented themſelves or known from others, as <hi>Sybils</hi> leaves, I mean as <hi>rare ſecrets</hi> not to be communicated. I hope that we ſhall ſee a more <hi>Communicative ſpirit</hi> amongſt us ere long. And Sir, I cannot but deſire you, if you have any things more in your hands of <hi>Gabriel Platte's,</hi> or any mens elſe, that you would with ſpeed publiſh them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Deficiency</hi> is, That we want a <hi>Place,</hi> to the which men may reſort for to find ſuch <hi>Ingenious</hi> men, as may be ſerviceable for their ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes; and alſo know where to find ſuch ſeeds, and plants, as they deſire, as the great <hi>Clover-graſſe, Saint Foine, La Lucerne,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Deficiency,</hi> That men do uſually covet great quantities of Land; yet cannot mannage a little well. There were amongſt the Auncient <hi>Romans</hi> ſome appointed to ſee that men did till their Lands as they ſhould do, and if they did not, to puniſh them as Enemies to the <hi>Publique;</hi> perhaps ſuch a law might not be amiſſe with us: for without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the <hi>Publique</hi> ſuffereth much, by private mens negligences; I therefore wiſh men to take <hi>Columell's</hi> Councell; which is, <hi>Laudato ingentia Rura, Exigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Colito.</hi> For <hi>melior eſt culta exiguitas</hi> &amp;c. as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaith, or as we ſay in Engliſh, <hi>A little Farme well tilled, is to be preferred:</hi> for then we ſhould not ſee ſo much waſte Land, but more Induſtry, greater Crops, and more people imployed, then are at this preſent, to the great profit of the <hi>Common-Wealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:114859:58"/>
               <p> 21. <hi>Deficiency</hi> is, <hi>That by reaſon of our ſins we have</hi> 
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">21 <hi>Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of our ſins we ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>not the bleſſing of the Lord upon our Labours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is the reaſon, that although the <hi>Husband-man</hi> hath been laborious and diligent in his calling theſe laſt years; yet our Crops have been thin, his Cattel ſwept away, &amp; ſcarcity &amp; famine hath ſeaſed on all parts of this Land; and if we had not been ſupplyed from abroad, we had quite devoured all the creatures of the Iſland, for our ſuſtenance, and yet we could not have been ſatisfyed, but muſt have devoured one another. And therefore to conclude; though I deſire the <hi>Husbandman</hi> to be diligent and laborious in his calling, yet I councell him to <hi>break off his ſins by Repentance,</hi> to have his eyes towards him, who is the <hi>Giver of every good thing,</hi> and to pray dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him for his bleſſings, who <hi>giveth freely to them that aske, and upbraideth not.</hi> And although all callings ought to look up to him that is <hi>on high;</hi> yet the <hi>Countrey-man</hi> eſpecially; for he hath a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate dependance on him then any other: for if the Lord withold his <hi>fat dew of Heaven,</hi> or the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer or latter Rain, it is in vain</hi> that the Huſhandman <hi>riſe up earely, and goe to bed late, and eate the bread of carefulneſſe:</hi> for we know, that it is the Lord <hi>that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth barren places fruitful,</hi> and he likewiſe <hi>that turneth fruitful Lands into barrenneſſe,</hi> (as the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> which was very fruitful even in the time of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> but now a barren deſert) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I again deſire the <hi>Countrey-man</hi> to walk as it becometh a <hi>Chriſtian, in all Sobriety, Righteouſneſſe and Godlyneſſe: not to truſt to his confidence, in his own labours,</hi> and good Huſbandry; <hi>but on the Lord that hath made all things:</hi> for though even <hi>Paul himſelfe</hi>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:114859:59"/> 
                  <hi>doth plant and Apollo doth water; yet it is only the Lord that giveth encreaſe</hi> and plenty, <hi>which he will not deny to thoſe that fear him: for they ſhall want nothing that is good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus <hi>Sir,</hi> I have written to you very largely my thoughts concerning the <hi>Husbandry</hi> of this <hi>Iſland,</hi> and partly what I have ſeen in many travels. <hi>Good Sir,</hi> be not offended at my long and impertinent ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, my rude language and unmethodical diſcourſe. It was, if not to ſatisfy; yet ſomewhat to gratify the univerſal goodneſſe of your ſpirit, and care of the <hi>Publique,</hi> which God hath enriched you withall. And theſe are onely my firſt thoughts, which in haſte I have hudled up together. I hope (if the Lord ſend life and health) my Second thoughts ſhall be better: But whatſoever I have done, pray look on it, as comming from one who is deſirous to ſerve you, and to advance the <hi>Publique Good,</hi> according to the talent the Lord hath given him.

                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſeverall things obſerved and ſet down during my ſtay in the Countrey, are theſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. I learned the whole <hi>way</hi> and <hi>Art,</hi> of making and ordering of <hi>Woad, viz.</hi> the time when they ſowe it, when firſt they weed it, and cut it. I ſaw the manner of their gathering it, grinding, balling, drying it, and after ſweating and curing it. Informing my ſelf of the whole charge and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of it: Have made divers Annotations on it: And taken order for ſome ſeed to be ſent to me, for other more Compendious and Profitable tryals, anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This and ſome other things gave me occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to make the beſt inquiry I could, of <hi>Houſe-wives</hi> and of <hi>Fowlers,</hi> for all ſorts of dying weeds, and herbs, uſed in the dying of wooll, or of nets, which I have carefully collected to improve to a more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary uſe; ſome being very remarkable.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Among other <hi>Generall Inquiries</hi> and <hi>Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> I heard of one at <hi>Ware,</hi> that charr'd <hi>Sea-coale;</hi> procured an errand and Commendations thither; went, was civilly uſed; and ſatisfyed in the truth and manner of the thing, and found the <hi>Gentleman</hi> who was the firſt <hi>Author</hi> of it, to be one <hi>Aires,</hi> now dead, an <hi>Ingenious</hi> man, a great <hi>Malſter,</hi> made much profit of it: It drying <hi>Malt</hi> as ſweet, as if the Sunne it ſelf did it: Is cheaper then either <hi>Wood,</hi> or <hi>Straw;</hi> and may be many other waies applyed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I went into the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Ely,</hi> to ſee one of the <hi>Holland-mills,</hi> for dreyning; though ſet up there and kept by certain <hi>Frenchmen.</hi> The <hi>Invention</hi> ſeemed to me but mean and rude, and Mr. <hi>Wheeler's</hi> way much more <hi>Ingenious.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:114859:60"/> 5. I ſaw at <hi>Wickleſen</hi> the manner of your <hi>Holland Sluces.</hi> The ruines alſo of a <hi>Cochlea,</hi> for the empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dreining of water, of which <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>baldus</hi> hath writ a whole <hi>Treatiſe.</hi> Likewiſe a petty kinde of <hi>Pinnace</hi> with ordinance, ſomewhat like a cloſe <hi>Litter,</hi> but <hi>Flat-bottom'd;</hi> which rowed with <hi>wheeles</hi> inſtead of <hi>Oares,</hi> imployed it ſeemes formerly with admirable ſucceſſe, for the taking in of <hi>Crowland,</hi> and which gave me a proofe of what I for many years have thought poſſible, and of very great uſe and ſervice, and ſtill think it of unknowne value, if it were skillfully indeed framed, and applyed as it might be.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The <hi>Lord</hi> F.

                  <p>THe information about the <hi>Lucerne</hi> that I have got from my Friend, being a very particular one, and containing a very full <hi>Anſwer</hi> to all the <hi>Questions</hi> propounded by your Friend; is ſuch as followeth: It requireth a rich ground, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what looſe and light, ſo as a ſtiffe <hi>Clay,</hi> and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>tough grounds</hi> are no waies fit for it; The ground muſt not be over-dry nor over-moiſt, but in a mean; yet ſomewhat more inclining to moiſture, then to the contrary. It muſt be ploughed three times; the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:114859:62"/> firſt time in <hi>October,</hi> and the ſecond and third, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Spring.</hi> Naturally it doth not love <hi>Dung,</hi> and cometh much better in a ground that is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently rich of it ſelf, then that which hath been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched by <hi>Dunging;</hi> and where <hi>Dung</hi> is made uſe of, it muſt be very ſtale and well rotten, and long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſowing-time. It cannot endure the cold, and therefore muſt not be ſowen till the cold wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all the danger of it, be quite paſt, viz. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the beginning or midſt of <hi>Aprill.</hi> The <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity</hi> of the <hi>Seed,</hi> is the <hi>Sixth part</hi> of <hi>Corne,</hi> that the ſame ground would require: ſo as only one Buſhell of <hi>Lucerne</hi> is to be ſowen on that ſpace of ground, which would require ſix Buſhells of <hi>Corne.</hi> It muſt be carefully weeded, eſpecially in the beginning. And to the end that it may take the more firm root, ſome <hi>Oates</hi> muſt be mixed with it, but in a very ſmall proportion. It is to be cut as ſoon as it begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to flower, which in the hot Countries <hi>(Provence, Languedock,</hi> and <hi>Spaine)</hi> it doth five or ſix times, and ſome years ſeven and eight times in a Summer: but in this Climate it uſeth to be cut but twice a year, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the end of <hi>June,</hi> and about the end of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:</hi> Being cut, it muſt be turned very oft, that it may dry the ſooner, and be carried off the ground the ſooneſt that may be; and it muſt be kept in cloſe barnes, being too tender for to be kept in reeks, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the aire, as other <hi>Hay.</hi> It is good for all kind of Cattel, <hi>Kine, Sheep, Goats,</hi> and as well for the young ones <hi>(Calves, Lambs, Kids)</hi> as for the others; but above all it agreeth beſt with <hi>Horſes.</hi> It is much more feeding then any other <hi>Hay:</hi> inſomuch as any lean beaſts will ſoon grow fat with it; and to Milch-beaſts,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:114859:63"/> it procureth abundance of milke: but it muſt never be given alone, eſpecially to beaſts that have not been long uſed to it: but muſt ever be mixed with <hi>Straw,</hi> or with ſome other <hi>Hay:</hi> for otherwiſe it over-heateth them, and filleth them too much with bloud; and that ſo ſuddenly, as it greatly indangereth their health, and their life too; which it doth principally to <hi>Kine:</hi> to whom it is more dangerous, if too plentifully given, then to any other Cattel. After the laſt cutting, you may let your Cattell graze on your <hi>Lucerne-fields,</hi> and that all Winter long, untill the beginning or mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of <hi>March.</hi> Of once ſowing you will have your <hi>Meadow</hi> continue good for 10. or 12. years, and until 15. and afterwards too, it will ſtill continue to bear; but the hearb will then notably decay in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Wherefore it is beſt to turn in then to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe. <hi>Kine</hi> muſt never eate of this hearb green; but onely dryed, and that moderately too, as hath been ſaid. But <hi>Horſes</hi> eating their fill of it green in the <hi>Spring,</hi> are purged thereby, and grow fat by it in 8. or 10. daies time: If one deſire to have of the <hi>Grain,</hi> one may let ſuch a proportion of the <hi>Meadow,</hi> as one will, grow up to ſeed, after the ſecond cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, any year except the firſt only: and when the ſeed is ripe; the tops of the hearb, with the coddes wherein the ſeed is incloſed, muſt be cut in a dewie morning, and put into ſheets, for fear of looſing the ſeed, and muſt be beate out with <hi>Flails</hi> upon the ſame, when that it is well dryed: and afterwards the remaining part of the hearb muſt be mowen cloſe to the ground; after which it continueth to ſprout out again after the uſual manner. The <hi>Hay</hi>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:114859:63"/> on't will keep good two or three years; and one A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre is ſufficient to keep three <hi>Horſes</hi> all the year long.</p>

And yet within theſe 2. or 3. days I met with a <hi>Phyſitian</hi> of <hi>Rochell,</hi> who aſſuring me that the <hi>Lucerne</hi> was very common in his <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,</hi> made me a relation of it agreeing with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, only in theſe three points, viz. That of once ſowing it will continue 10 or 12. years; That it is cut twice a year, ſerving afterwards for <hi>Paſture</hi> all Winter; And that it wonderfully fatteneth all kind of Cattel; but very much different from it in all the others, and in ſome of them point-blank contrary to it. For he ſaith, that it is to be ſowen in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>March;</hi> that it deſireth a temperate ground, but rather dry then wet, and no waies fat
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:114859:64"/> nor clayiſh, but ſtony and gravily; that it need not be mixed with any other <hi>Hay,</hi> but may be given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and all the year long; in <hi>Summer</hi> aſwell as in <hi>Winter;</hi> not only to <hi>Horſes,</hi> but to <hi>Cowes</hi> and other Cattel. He added, that the proportion of the ſeed, is the charge of a Porter for four <hi>Arpents</hi> or <hi>French</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres. Which particulars I thought good to impart unto you; that your <hi>Friend</hi> comparing them with the other's, might make his beſt profit of them; and this <hi>Rochellois;</hi> (or <hi>Rocheller)</hi> who hath lived 3. or 4. years in <hi>England,</hi> thinks that the <hi>Lucerne</hi> will come admirably well in that Countrey.</p>

                  <p>J Have received from you a <hi>Relation</hi> of a very great and wonderful <hi>Production</hi> or <hi>Increaſe,</hi> which your Friend at <hi>Amsterdam</hi> relates to be done in <hi>France.</hi> I am farre from leſſening the admirable greatneſſe of that perſon's skill and ſucceſſe. Only ſince I find my ſelfe taken notice of by the ſame party, and the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment</hi> I made the laſt year of <hi>Barly</hi> weighed in the ſcales with this, and found too light; I ſhall take leave to ſay, that (beſides all difference that is or may be conceived to be, betwixt the <hi>Soyles;</hi> that of <hi>France</hi> hath a manifeſt advantage in the elevation
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:114859:66"/> and powerful operation of the Sun.) That it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable he did uſe all poſſible <hi>Meanes</hi> both to the <hi>Ground</hi> and <hi>Seed</hi> to make them both fruitful, which I did not at all; but quite contrarily I choſe the worſt ſeed I could procure, and my ground was as barren as any whatſoever in the parts adjacent. I added nothing to either; all I did was after the blade was ſprung up. And whereas your Friend mentions 600. out of 80. eares, thoſe ears contained, one with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the leaſt 30. ſingle cornes, which is 2400. That beſides that, <hi>Wheate</hi> is no whit inferior to <hi>Barly,</hi> but rather more inclined of its proper nature to branch and ſpread. It is alſo allowed as long time againe to grow, and therefore may better ſpread to many ears then <hi>Barly.</hi> That my eares of <hi>Barly</hi> rated at 30. one with the other, (which they were at leaſt, ſome having 38. a thing I ſuppoſe rarely (if ever) ſeen in <hi>England</hi> before) are full as high as his <hi>Wheate-eares</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at 52. And the ſeeming great difference between 2400. and 6000. when looked into, will prove not to be in the number of eares, which differ no more then as 14. to 10. but in the nature of the Graines, there being univerſally as many more in an eare of <hi>Wheate</hi> as in an eare of <hi>Barly.</hi> That if (as it is moſt like) he in <hi>France</hi> did onely try concluſions, to what height nature might poſſibly be ſcrued by <hi>Art,</hi> and that what is here related, was the effect of that tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; that holds not compariſon with mine, which is generally <hi>practicable,</hi> without any conſiderable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of time or ſtock more then in the <hi>common-way.</hi> Laſtly I affirme, in all poſſible humble reference and ſubmiſſion to God's good pleaſure, power and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; that when I ſhall make uſe of good <hi>Seed</hi>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:114859:66"/> rightly prepared, <hi>good Land</hi> in right condition, &amp; all other <hi>helps</hi> which I know &amp; can uſe; I ſhall not doubt for ſmaller numbers of the ſame graine (viz.) <hi>Wheate</hi> to produce 200. or 300. eares, and in them 10000. 12000. or 15000. cornes, (and ſomewhat like that, for whole fields together, and that here in <hi>England,)</hi> howſoever let us alwaies remember to give all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible praiſe to God, <hi>whoſe bleſſing onely makes rich.</hi>

                  <p>I Find dayly more and more, that it is too true, that moſt men love money, that they even wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:114859:68"/> it in their hearts, as the onely <hi>Summum Bonum.</hi> I need not go farre for a proofe, ſince they have brought one to my hand. That (having ſo faire and juſt offers made, in order to the Corne-buſineſs; as I have preſented to them by your hands,) will by no meanes (though ſo very much to their <hi>own profit</hi> and the <hi>Publique Good)</hi> part with their monies; and yet ſtick not to demand (in effect) the diſcovery from me of that talent of knowledge, which God hath made mine by his free gift; as the reward of my Induſtry, and faithful love to my native <hi>Countrey;</hi> (An <hi>Eſtate,</hi> if I miſtake not better gotten then by any of the common meanes; by which men grow rich dayly.) Surely the commodities cannot be leſſe then equal. The moſt wiſe and vertuous men that ever lived, have preferred <hi>Art, Induſtry</hi> and <hi>Ingenuity</hi> farre before money. <hi>Money</hi> (eſpecially the <hi>Abuſe</hi> of it) is become the very <hi>Poyſon</hi> of the world, againſt which <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Induſtry</hi> is an <hi>Antidote</hi> or <hi>Cordiall.

And finally, if they judge it improvidence to part with a little of their eſtates, onely for a time, to returne
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:114859:68"/> againe to them ſhortly, like <hi>Noah's</hi> Dove with an <hi>Olive-branch,</hi> a double branch of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Proſperity:</hi> I deſire to be excuſ'd, if I upon better grounds, hold it prophane to ſell a better right then a birth-right for leſſe then a meſſe of pottage; even for juſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and for ever.
